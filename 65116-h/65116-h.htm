    <h2>PUBLISHER’S NOTE.</h2>
  </div>
  <hr />

  <p>This volume is the concluding one of a series projected by the late
    <span class="smcap">John Gilmary Shea</span>, LL. D., on the “Discovery and Explorations
    of the Mississippi Valley.” The initial volume, issued in 1852,
    comprises the Narratives of Marquette, Allouez, Membré, Hennepin and
    Anastase Douay. The second, issued in 1861, contains those of Cavelier,
    St. Cosme, Le Seuer, Gravier and Guignas.
  </p>

  <p>The present volume, giving Joutel’s Journal of La Salle’s third and
    last voyage, is reprinted from the first English translation of 1714,
    of the original French edition of 1713.</p>

  <p>A <i>facsimile</i> reprint of the above English edition was issued
    (privately) by the Caxton Club of Chicago, in 1896, in an edition of
    203 copies, and enriched by textual notes by Prof. <span class="smcap">Melville B.
    Anderson</span>, now of Menlo Park, California,—the result of his careful
    collation of the English with the French original. These notes, by
    the special permission of Mr. Anderson, have been incorporated in the
    present volume and indicated by his initials.</p>

  <p>With a view, also, to render this edition as compendious a source of
    reference as possible for the student of this subject, we have added,
    by the courtesy of the author, the exceedingly full and valuable
    “Bibliography of the Discovery and Explorations in the Mississippi
    Valley,” by Mr. <span class="smcap">Appleton P. C. Griffin</span>, formerly of the Boston
    Public Library, now Chief Bibliographer of the Library of Congress,
    Washington, D. C.</p>

  <div class="center large"><span class="smcap">La Salle’s Two Previous Voyages.</span></div>

  <p>The earliest French explorers of the seventeenth century, among the
    great lakes and rivers of the North American continent,—Champlain,
    Nicolet, Marquette, Hennepin, Joliet and La Salle—were men of no
    common mould. Whether clerics, imbued with the enthusiasm of their
    holy faith, or laymen, dominated by the love of adventure and the
    prospect of adding to the wealth and glory of their beloved France,
    their ideals were sublime, their labors prodigious, their sufferings
    heroic, their perseverance indomitable. They possessed “the courage of
    their convictions;” and despite the difficulties, dangers, and reverses
    which befell them, their successive explorations all contributed to the
    result finally achieved by La Salle,—the discovery of the “Father of
    Waters”—the Mississippi.</p>

  <p>“Second only to Champlain, among the heroes of Canadian history,” says
    John Fiske,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> “stands Robert Cavelier de la Salle—a man of iron, if
    ever there was one—a man austere and cold in manner, and endowed with
    such indomitable pluck and perseverance as have never been surpassed
    in the world. He did more than any other man to extend the dominion
    of France in the New World. As Champlain had founded the colony of
    Canada, and opened the way to the great lakes, so La Salle completed
    the discovery of the Mississippi, and added to the French possessions
    the vast province of Louisiana.”</p>

  <p>René Robert Cavelier, better known as La Salle, from the name of the
    family’s estate, was born, in 1643, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
    Rouen, Normandy, France. The Caveliers, though not ennobled, were
    citizens of marked social and some official distinction in that
    ancient and wealthy city. His father, Jean, and his uncle Henri, were
    rich merchants, and the latter, at least, was one of the “Hundred
    Associates” of Cardinal Richelieu, a syndicate largely interested in
    trade with the territorial possessions of France, in America.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Being
    an earnest Catholic, Robert, at an early age, became connected with
    the Jesuits, and in their schools acquired an excellent education,
    especially in the higher mathematics and the exact sciences. His
    nature, however, was one which chafed under the restrictions of a
    monastic order; and he subsequently withdrew from them, though on good
    terms, and with a reputation as a bright scholar, and of unimpeachable
    morals. Free to seek a wider field for his activities than that offered
    by an ecclesiastical career, his attention was drawn to Canada, where
    an elder brother, John Cavelier, a priest of the Sulpitian order, was
    then residing. But, as his connection with and withdrawal from the
    Jesuit order had—under a recent French law—deprived him of any claim
    upon the estate of his recently deceased father, he lacked the means
    needed for the voyage thither. Finally, he obtained an allowance
    (probably from his family) of 300 or 400 livres, with which slender sum
    he sailed to seek his fortune, in the spring of 1666.</p>

  <p>Shortly after his arrival at Montreal, he received from the Superior of
    the Sulpitian Seminary, which had recently become the feudal lord of
    that city, a large grant of land (a “seigniory”) in that vicinity.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
    This he immediately proceeded to improve, by the introduction of new
    settlers as tenants, the erection of buildings, and the cultivation of
    the soil. It is probable, however, that even before coming <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>to Canada
    he had outlined to himself a much wider sphere of activity. For, with
    the prevision which was a feature of his character, he spent much
    of his time during the first two years of his life at La Chine, in
    mastering the Indian languages, especially those of the Iroquois and
    Algonquin dialects. And in this, he evidently struck upon the initial
    point of his future career. For, from a party of Senecas who visited
    with him several weeks at his seigniory, he learned of a great river
    (which they called the Ohio) “flowing into the sea,” and only to be
    reached by a journey of eight or nine months. This, he conceived,
    might be the river of which he had already heard as emptying into the
    “Vermilion Sea,” or Gulf of California, and, thinking that perchance
    it might possibly prove to be a northwest route to China, he projected
    a voyage of discovery thither.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> With this in view he planned a visit
    to the Senecas, to learn all that they might know in relation to the
    matter. Communicating his plans to the Governor (Courcelle) and the
    Intendant (Talon) of Canada, he received from them the necessary
    authorization to make the attempt. But first, as it must be made at
    his own expense, and as he had already spent all his means upon the
    improvement of his seigniory, he was obliged to sell his lands, etc.,
    mainly to the Seminary, from which he had obtained them. He, also,
    though perhaps rather unfortunately, joined his interests with those of
    the Sulpitians, in a voyage of discovery which that order were about to
    make for missionary purposes, in the same direction.</p>

  <div class="center large mt3"><span class="smcap">The First Voyage of Exploration</span>, 1669–1675.</div>

  <p>This joint expedition, under command of La Salle, started from La
    Chine, July 6th, 1669, with the Ohio river as its objective point. It
    consisted of 4 canoes, and 15 <span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>men of La Salle’s party; 3 canoes and 7
    men of the Sulpitian contingent, and 2 canoes of Seneca Indians, acting
    as guides—9 canoes and 24 men in all. Thirty-five days travel brought
    them to the Seneca village (Irondequoit, on the south side of Lake
    Ontario), where they found a cordial welcome, but, also, difficulty
    in obtaining guides. While thus delayed, there arrived in camp two
    Frenchmen, one of whom was Louis Joliet, fur-trader and voyageur,
    himself an honorable figure in the annals of western discovery. Joliet,
    who had visited the upper lakes, whither he had been sent by Talon,
    the French Intendant at Montreal, to discover and report upon the
    copper mines of Lake Superior, showed to the priests of La Salle’s
    party a map which he had made of that region, and of which he gave
    them a copy; and he told them, moreover, of the heathenish condition
    of the Pottawatomies and other tribes dwelling in those parts. This
    so inflamed the religious zeal of the priests that they incontinently
    lost all their interest in the Ohio project, and determined to deflect
    their course toward the lake region, despite all the objections which
    La Salle could urge. So that, being firmly set in his own designs,
    he urged a recent illness as his excuse for parting with them; and
    the Sulpitians started northward, and got back to Montreal in June,
    1670, with nothing to show (owing to sundry misfortunes and losses,
    especially that of their altar-service, without which they could not
    convert the heathen) either in the way of discovery, or of missionary
    results. La Salle’s movements, after this “parting of the ways,” and
    for two years following, are somewhat involved in obscurity. There is
    little doubt, however, that he was busily engaged in explorations and
    discoveries of some importance.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Certain it is, that he discovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
    the Ohio, since his own assertion of the fact, in a memoir addressed to
    Count Frontenac, in 1677, is confirmed by the testimony of his rival,
    Joliet, upon whose two maps of the Mississippi and the great lakes, the
    Ohio is depicted with an inscription stating that it had been explored
    by La Salle.</p>

  <p>The evidence of his having, on this voyage, reached and descended the
    Mississippi is not so clear. What militates most strongly against the
    assumption that he did so, is the fact, that, though he kept journals
    and made maps of this trip, which were, as late as 1765, in possession
    of a niece then living in France, at an advanced age; yet, when, after
    La Salle’s death, this niece together with an uncle and a nephew of
    the explorer petitioned the King for a certain grant in consideration
    of the discoveries made by their distinguished relative, they made no
    mention of such discovery, as they would most likely have done if they
    had known of it.</p>

  <p>But the discovery of the Illinois river must, undoubtedly, be credited
    to him.</p>

  <p>Returning to Canada, from his long wanderings, he found great changes
    going on in that country. It was no longer simply a missionary field,
    but was fast assuming the form and character of a colony. A royal
    Viceroy, or Governor-General, had taken the place of the former
    Governor and Intendant; and the controlling interests of the Sulpitian
    order were now largely overshadowed by those of the Jesuits. Both Count
    Frontenac, the Governor, and the Intendant Talon, were men of similar
    character and held like views with La Salle. Like him, they entertained
    plans of wider scope than those of any previous Canadian officials. And
    when he broached his plan of finding and opening up of the Mississippi,
    and the rich southern country through which it ran, and of fortifying
    along its course, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>and especially at its outlet, against the incursions
    of the Spanish and English, he enlisted their ready sympathy. Thus,
    leaving to the Jesuits, with a dislike of whom they all three seemed
    to have been imbued, the frozen Canadian country; and to the English,
    that portion of the continent east of the Alleghanies, they proposed to
    themselves to conquer the remainder of this vast territory for the King
    of France.</p>

  <p>The generally accepted French policy of that day, in regard to the
    acquisition of new territory in North America, was that the discovery
    of a great river gave to all the territory drained by such river an
    inchoate (or inceptive) title, which later could be completed by
    occupation. It was the attempt to carry out this policy which cost
    (and lost) France the Seven Years War, in which the politics and
    history of America and Europe became inextricably mixed. And of this
    policy, Count Frontenac, the Governor, Talon, the Intendant, and La
    Salle, the explorer, now became the leading exponents in Canada. They
    were all exceptionally strong men, full of ambitions and untiring
    energy, and their scheme combined not only military occupation, but
    the reclamation of the Indian tribes and their concentration around
    the proposed chain of French forts, together with colonies of French
    immigrants of an agricultural and industrial character, the extension
    of the buffalo fur-trade, etc.—in fact a most enchanting <i lang="fr">mirage</i>
    of future civilization and Christianity in the vast central area of
    this continent. In itself, the scheme was too vast to be more than
    a sketch of future possibilities; and, moreover, it ignored certain
    needs and facts which were most important to its success. For instance,
    the French immigration to this country, at that time, was totally
    inadequate to furnish settlers enough, and with sufficient rapidity
    to ensure the successful colonization of the new territory. Again,
    the pacification among themselves, of the numerous and warring Indian
    tribes which occupied this western continent, and the securing of their
    peaceful and friendly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span> co-operation with the whites, was a work almost
    impossible within the limits of a generation or more—and, until it was
    done, colonization would be slow, and its difficulties and dangers
    deterrent to such emigration. Another inherent point of weakness in
    the plan was the difficulty of keeping in touch with and depending
    upon a home government thousands of miles away, as well as the
    uncertain nature of such dependence in the political, commercial, and
    ecclesiastical conflicts which would be apt to arise, and necessarily
    would have to be adjusted, more or less, through the medium of Colonial
    officials—whose motives would not always be free from the imputation of
    self-interest.</p>

  <p>The jealousy of the Jesuits, now conscious of their waning power in the
    affairs of the new Colonial <i lang="fr">régime</i>, had always been felt by La
    Salle—and probably with good reason—to be inimical to his plans; and
    the future held out no hope of its being less persistent or bitter.</p>

  <p>The personality of the explorer, also, weighed fully as much against,
    as for, the success of his undertaking. By nature cold, reserved,
    and reticent, he was not a genial man; and possessed little or none
    of that magnetism which wins men’s hearts. Absorbed, as he was, with
    the details of his great plans, and the responsibilities which they
    imposed upon him, he was ever self-contained and self-repressed. Even
    the few most faithful and trusted companions of his labors could hardly
    be considered as on terms of intimacy with him. And the necessity of
    maintaining the strictest discipline among the class of men by whose
    following and aid he had to carry on his work—voyageurs, <i lang="fr">courriers
    des bois</i>, traders, canoeists, and Indians—who comprehended him not,
    but were simply compelled by the force of his will, certainly did not
    tend to establish that community of interest which should have existed
    between them. It was, in fact, this lacking quality in an otherwise
    magnificent character, which was ever thwarting his plans and which
    rendered his brief career of eight years in exploration work an almost
    uninterrupted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span> record of disaster—leading—though with one momentary
    triumph—to a tragic end.</p>

  <p>Omniscience is denied to Man. It belongs only to the Creator, who has
    given to men, in its place, the limited faculty of foresight. And, with
    such foresight as they had, the three promoters of the fortunes of New
    France—Count Frontenac, Talon, and La Salle—formulated their plans, and
    in the autumn of 1674 the latter sailed for France, to obtain the royal
    sanction and the moneyed help which were needed. Whatever the strength
    or the weaknesses of their project, money was their <i lang="la">sine qua non</i>.</p>

  <p><i>La Salle’s first return to France.</i> Bearing strong letters
    of recommendation from Frontenac to the French Minister of State,
    Colbert,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> he met with a cordial reception at home. In response to
    his petitions to the King, he was, in consideration of his services
    as an explorer, raised to the ranks of the untitled nobility<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and
    was granted the seigniory of the new post on Lake Ontario, which, in
    honor to his patron, was named Fort Frontenac. He was also invested
    with the command of the same, together with that of the settlement
    around it, subject to the authority of his friend the Governor-General.
    On his part he undertook to repay to the King the cost of the fort,
    to maintain it, at his own charge, with a garrison equal to that of
    Montreal, besides laborers; to form a French colony around it, as well
    as one of domesticated Indians near by; to build a church and support
    one or more Récollet friars.</p>

  <p>He had but little trouble, now that he was in the sunshine of royal
    favor, in obtaining from his gratified family and friends the needed
    funds; and on his return to Canada<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> (1675), proceeded to comply with
    the terms of his seigniorial grant. Within two years, the original
    wooden fort was replaced by a much larger one of cut stone, on the
    land side, and on the outer side by palisades, and its walls manned by
    nine small cannon. On the inside it contained barracks, a guard-house,
    officers’ quarters, a forge, a well, a mill, and a bakery—all of
    substantial build. Its garrison consisted of two officers, a surgeon,
    and ten or twelve soldiers, with a large number of masons, laborers,
    and canoe-men. Near the two villages which stretched along the shore
    south of the fort (one of French farm-tenants, the other of friendly
    Iroquois) were the chapel and residence of two Récollet friars. Over
    a hundred (French) acres of cleared and cultivated land, and cattle,
    fowl, and swine, brought from Montreal, gave ample evidence of
    permanent occupation; and four vessels for lake and river navigation,
    as well as a fleet of canoes, hinted strongly at the seignior’s
    predilection for travel and exploration. Feudal lord of the entire
    region around him (for the nearest settlement was a week’s journey
    distant), commander of a garrison paid by himself, founder and patron
    of a church, he was now literally “master of all which he surveyed;”
    and had he been content so to remain, would soon have become a
    merchant-prince, for, ere long, as estimated by a friend, he was
    “making more than 25,000 livres a year.”</p>

  <p>His cup of success, however, was not without its infusion of
    bitterness. He found himself in a very maelstrom of opposition and
    detraction, arising from the jealousy of those interested in the
    Montreal fur-trade, (especially among the Jesuits), who saw in the
    royal favors conferred on La Salle the ultimate downfall of their own
    interests. In this violent imbroglio of commercial, political and
    priestly rivalry, envy, malice, contemptible, and persistent espionage,
    and even poison, played their respective parts.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the free life of Nature was wooing his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span> spirit, the fever
    of exploration was still strong upon him; and he valued the position
    he had attained only as a stepping-stone to the realization of his
    life-long dream.</p>

  <p><i>La Salle’s second return visit to France.</i> So, in the autumn of
    1677, leaving his fort and seigniory in charge of a trusted lieutenant,
    La Forest, who was also one of his partners in the proposed fur-trade,
    La Salle sailed again for France. There, lodged modestly in a rather
    obscure quarter of Paris, he renewed the friendships and associations
    which he had formed during his previous visit; and added to them by
    making new and valuable friends. Among these were the Marquis de
    Seignelay, the Prince de Conti, La Motte de Sussière, and last but
    not least, Henri de Tonti, thenceforth his foremost companion in his
    Western labors.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> La Salle also received from the King a royal patent
    authorizing him to explore and occupy the Mississippi country, “through
    which, to all appearances, a way may be found to Mexico.” This patent,
    confirmatory of that granted him in 1675, imposed upon him the erection
    and maintenance of such forts as he might deem necessary, and gave him
    a monopoly for five years of the trade in buffalo hides. The whole
    expense was to be borne (as was the custom of the monarchs of that day,
    in granting lands which they did not own, and the privileges which such
    grants carried with them) by the grantee. The fur-trade of the Montreal
    colony was not to be interfered with; nor did the patent include any
    provision or encouragement of the industrial or colonization scheme
    which had fully taken <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>possession of La Salle’s mind. Content, however,
    with what he could get in the way of kingly favor—on the principle,
    perhaps, that “half a loaf is better than no loaf,” the adventurer
    turned his attention to securing the needed funds, and soon, by loans
    from friends and family, and by mortgages upon his Fort Frontenac
    property, had raised sufficient to carry out his purpose.</p>

  <p>On the 14th July, 1678, Le Sieur La Salle, as he must thenceforth be
    called, with Tonti, La Motte, and 30 men, mostly ship carpenters, with
    a cargo of iron, cordage, anchors, etc., sufficient for the equipment
    of two vessels, set sail for Quebec, where they arrived after a two
    months’ voyage. Here they met with Father Hennepin, a Récollet friar,
    who had come to Canada three years before, and whose name from this
    point is prominently connected with American Western exploration.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

  <p><span class="smcap">The Second Voyage of Exploration</span> (1678–1679) was virtually
    commenced, under the orders of La Salle (who was with Tonti) detained
    at Quebec by his own affairs, and the difficulties arising from the
    machinations of his enemies,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> by La Motte and Hennepin. They set
    sail, from Fort Frontenac, November 18th, 1678, in a small vessel
    of ten tons; but it was not until the 6th of December that they
    reached the mouth of the Niagara river and saw the grand cataract of
    which Hennepin’s pencil has preserved the first known picture and
    description. Two leagues above the mouth of the Niagara river La Motte
    began the erection of a fort, where he was joined later by La Salle
    and Tonti. Here, under almost unsurmountable <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>obstacles, due to the
    excessive cold, and hunger, as well as jealousies among the men, and
    the distrust of the Indians, a ship-yard was improvised, and a vessel
    of about 45 tons was builded and equipped with five small cannon. She
    was named the <cite>Griffin</cite>, in honor of the Governor-General, and her
    prow was ornamented with a grotesque figure of that somewhat apocryphal
    animal, in compliment to his family arms.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

  <p>The building of this fort and of the <cite>Griffin</cite> was a masterstroke
    of La Salle’s, for Niagara was the key to the four great upper lakes
    (Erie, Huron, Superior, and Michigan), and by its position would
    control the fur-trade of the whole northern country. In time of peace
    it would intercept the trade between the Iroquois and the Dutch and
    English at Albany; in time of war it would be a menace to both.</p>

  <p>Any forward movement, however, was delayed from February until August,
    1679, by the absence of La Salle, who had been obliged to return, with
    Tonti, to Fort Frontenac for needed supplies, and to attend to some of
    his private affairs. For his creditors, excited by false reports of his
    insolvency, had seized upon all his available property, outside of his
    seigniory.</p>

  <p>Despite these embarrassments, however, he pushed forward his
    enterprise, and by the 7th of August the <cite>Griffin</cite> was sailing
    upon the waters of Lake Erie, never before ploughed by the keel of
    a white man’s ship. Passing through the Straits of Detroit and into
    Lake Huron, they stayed not their course, although nearly wrecked by
    a fierce gale, until, early in September, they dropped anchor at the
    entrance of Green Bay, within the waters of Lake Michigan. Here, at
    Michilimackinac, was a Jesuit mission and centre of Indian trade,
    where they were received with show of welcome by the holy fathers, and
    with evident distrust by their Indian <i lang="fr">protegés</i>. Here La Salle
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>found that a party of his men whom he had sent on in advance to the
    Illinois, to trade for him and make preparations for his coming, had
    been tampered with, had appropriated the goods in their charge to their
    own uses, and that many of them were missing. Six of these rascals were
    found at Michilimackinac, and with two found by Tonti at the Sault Ste.
    Marie, were captured with their plunder and the remainder had taken
    to the woods. It had been La Salle’s intention to leave his party at
    this point to proceed on their way to the Illinois, under Tonti, while
    he himself should return to Canada, to look after and protect his own
    concerns there. But Tonti was just then absent, and there was great
    need of his remaining with his men, lest they should again be enticed
    away from their duty. Besides, he was desirous to frustrate a plan of
    his enemies, which he thought he had discovered, to set the Iroquois
    “by the ears” with the Illinois, with a view to draw him into the war,
    and thus interrupt his plans.</p>

  <p>Finally sailing westward into Lake Michigan he found near Green Bay<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
    several faithful men of the advance party whom he had sent out, who had
    collected there and on the way thither, a considerable store of furs;
    which he determined to send back to Niagara, on the <cite>Griffin</cite>,
    to satisfy his exacting creditors, with orders to return to the
    head of Lake Michigan as soon as possible.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> She set sail on this
    return voyage on the 18th of September, in the face of a storm, which
    prevailed for several days. In the same storm, also, La Salle and the
    fourteen men left to him, by numerous desertions <i lang="fr">en route</i>,
    resumed their journey, in four canoes, heavily laden with a forge,
    tools, merchandise, and arms. It was no pleasure trip; twice they
    were swamped, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>and nearly lost the contents of their canoes, as well
    as their lives: drenched, cold, and without provisions, they suffered
    much, and distrust of the Indians with whom they met on shore increased
    their sufferings. But steadily he pushed on along the western coast of
    Lake Michigan, and circled around its southern end until he reached the
    mouth of the St. Joseph, called by him the Miami. Here he had expected
    to meet Tonti with twenty men, coming along the eastern shore of the
    lake from Michilimackinac. But no Tonti was there. It was the 1st of
    November, the streams were freezing over, and their provisions were
    failing. Unless they could reach the villages of the Illinois before
    the Indians left for their winter hunt, starvation might be their
    fate. The dissatisfaction of his men presaged mutiny and desertion,
    but La Salle firmly refused to remove from the place where they were,
    and affirmed his intention, if they should desert, to remain with his
    Mohegan hunter and the three friars of his party until the arrival of
    Tonti. Then, the better to occupy their thoughts, he set them to work
    on the building of a timber fort. Twenty days later, and when this work
    was well under way, Tonti appeared, but with only half of his men.
    Provisions having failed, he had left the remainder thirty leagues
    behind, to get their living as best they might, by hunting. But La
    Salle sent him back, with two men, to find and bring them forward. On
    this return trip, their canoe was swamped in a violent gale, and guns,
    baggage, and provisions were lost and they returned to the fort on the
    Miami, subsisting on acorns by the way. The balance of Tonti’s party,
    except a couple of deserters, came into camp a few days after.</p>

  <p>But the <cite>Griffin</cite> came not back to the waiting party. Nor was her
    fate ever known; whether she was lost by stress of storm, by Indian
    attack, or (as La Salle always thought) by treachery of her pilot.
    Longer delay, however, was impossible: and so, after sending back two
    of his men to Michilimackinac, and to pilot her, if she still existed,
    to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span> Miami fort, his party, numbering 33 in all, was re-embarked,
    3rd December, 1679, on the St. Joseph, keeping a sharp lookout along
    the right-hand shore for the path or portage leading to the headwaters
    of the Illinois river. This, owing to the absence of the Mohegan
    hunter, they missed, and La Salle went on shore to look it up, lost his
    way, and passed a dismal night in a thick snowstorm. Meantime Tonti and
    Hennepin, growing uneasy, also landed, ordered guns to be fired, and
    sent out men to find their lost commander, if possible. He was found
    near morning, and, with the aid of the Mohegan, who had returned, the
    portage was also found and La Salle, excessively fatigued, turned in,
    with Hennepin, for a little rest in a wigwam which was covered with
    mats made of reeds. During the night the cold forced them to kindle a
    fire, from which the mats caught ablaze, so that before daybreak they
    were turned out into the cold again, having barely escaped being burned
    with their shelter. In the morning, shouldering their canoes, they
    started across the portage to the headwaters of the Illinois—distant
    some five miles. As the party filed along on their way, a disgruntled
    man, who walked behind La Salle, raised his gun to shoot him in the
    back, but was prevented by a companion. Reaching the Kankakee, one of
    the sources of the Illinois, they floated their canoes on its thin
    and sluggish stream; and passing through wide areas of swamps, and
    prairies, glided along at the base of “Starved Rock” near the great
    town of the Illinois, and on New Year’s Day, 1680, reached the head of
    the Illinois river, where they landed, and Father Hennepin celebrated
    the Mass. Four days later they had reached the long expansion—the river
    now called Peoria Lake, and near its southern end they came upon a
    large camp of Indians, who received them at first with surprise and
    enmity. But La Salle and his men leaped ashore, and by his bravery and
    knowledge of Indian character quelled their fears, so that Frenchmen
    and Indians were soon seated together at a feast such as the former
    had not for some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> time seen. The calumet of peace was exchanged and La
    Salle explained to his hosts his object and his wish for peace, so that
    they all retired to sleep in amity. In the morning, however, La Salle
    found that he was regarded with distrust, and soon learned that Indian
    emissaries from another tribe had been tampering, over-night, with his
    hosts—who now appeared quite indisposed to friendship. He saw, in this
    sudden change of front, the hand of the Jesuits, and when, at a second
    feast, tendered by one of the chiefs, he was urged to desist from
    his plan of descending the Mississippi, by arguments of the number,
    valor, and ferocity of the tribes inhabiting its valley, the terrors
    of alligators, serpents, and unnatural monsters, and the fearful
    nature of the river itself, he was fully confirmed in his opinion. In
    a strong, but temperate address, La Salle declared his disbelief in
    those marvelous tales, and affirmed that they were lies, inspired by
    French jealousy of his project, and sent them through Iroquois sources.
    A few days later, a band of Mississippi Indians visited the camp, from
    whom he learned the utter falsity of these stories and also had the
    assurance that the tribes along that river would receive the white men
    with favor. On this he took the first opportunity, at another feast, of
    confronting the Illinois chiefs with so full a description of the river
    (which he said had been communicated to him by “the Great Spirit”) its
    course and its final meeting with the sea, that his savage hearers
    “clapped their hands to their mouths,” in astonishment, and conceiving
    him to be a sorcerer, confessed that what they had said was false and
    inspired only by their desire to retain him amongst them.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, he had determined to fortify himself for the winter (it
    was now the middle of January) in a position where he could face an
    Illinois outbreak, or an Iroquois invasion, better than he could do
    in the Indian camp where he was then a guest. Taking advantage of a
    thaw, which temporarily reopened the frozen river, he with Hennepin,
    in a canoe, sought and soon found the site he had chosen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span> on a low
    hill, or knoll, half a league from the camp and about 200 yards from
    the southern bank. In front of this knoll was a marsh, overflowed
    at high tide, and on either side a ravine. A ditch was dug behind
    this knoll, connecting these two ravines, and thus isolating it from
    the mainland. On each side of the hill, which was nearly square,
    an embankment was thrown up and its sloping sides were guarded by
    <i lang="fr">chevaux-de-frise</i>, and a 25-foot palisade surrounded the whole.
    The buildings within this area were of musket-proof timber. This fort,
    the first civilized act of occupation in the present State of Illinois,
    he named Fort Crèvecœur.</p>

  <p>“La Salle’s men,” says Parkman, “were for the most part raw hands,
    knowing nothing of the wilderness, and easily alarmed at its dangers,
    * * * it was to the last degree difficult to hold men to their duty.
    Once fairly in the wilderness, completely freed from the sharp
    restraints of authority in which they had passed their lives, a spirit
    of lawlessness broke out among them with a violence proportioned to the
    pressure which had hitherto suppressed it. Discipline had no resources
    and no guarantee; while these outlaws of the forest, the <i lang="fr">courriers
    des bois</i>, were always before their eyes, a standing example of
    unbridled license.” Desertions and disaffections among his followers
    were, at this time, a heavy burden to La Salle; and he even barely
    escaped from another attempt to poison him. Finally, however, having
    apparently placated the Indians of the vicinity, and checked, as he
    hoped, the disposition to mutiny and desertion among his men, which had
    been a constant menace to his plans,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> he built, in an incredibly
    short time, a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>vessel of 40 tons’ burden with which to descend the
    river to the Mississippi. He also sent Hennepin and two others in a
    canoe to explore the Illinois to its junction with the larger river. He
    himself, having now given up all hopes of the <cite>Griffin</cite>, began a
    return to Canada, for needed supplies, in canoes, with four Frenchmen
    and an Indian hunter, leaving the faithful Tonti, with a dozen or
    so men to hold the fort and guard the half-finished ship. It was a
    desperate journey, but he felt that unless the articles lost in the
    <cite>Griffin</cite> were replaced without delay, the expedition would be
    retarded for a full year, and probably utterly foiled by the additional
    expense which would be incurred for the support of his men. On the way
    he met the two men whom he had sent back to Michilimackinac in search
    of the <cite>Griffin</cite>, but they brought him no tidings of her fate, and
    ordering them to join Tonti at Fort Crèvecœur, he pressed firmly on. He
    also took occasion to examine the capabilities of the “Starved Rock”
    upon the Illinois, and sent back word to Tonti to make it a stronghold
    of defense in case of necessity. His journey occupied sixty-five days
    of incessant toil, danger, and accidents that rendered it “the most
    adventurous one ever made by a Frenchman in America;” he himself was
    the only one of the party who did not break down, either from fatigue
    or illness, and when Lake Erie was reached, it was his arm alone which
    ferried their canoe over to the blockhouse at Niagara. They reached
    Fort Frontenac on the 6th of May, and he pushed on directly to Montreal.</p>

  <p>His sudden reappearance there caused the greatest astonishment;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span> and
    he was met on every hand with news of disaster. Both Man and Nature
    seemed in arms against him; his agents had plundered him, creditors
    had seized upon his property, a vessel from France, laden with stores
    valued at over 10,000 crowns, had been lost at the mouth of the St.
    Lawrence, and of twenty men hired in Europe, some had been detained by
    the Intendant Duchesneau, and all but four of the remainder had been
    told that he was dead, and had returned home. Yet, undaunted by these
    staggering blows of Fortune, he went vigorously to work; and, within
    a week, succeeded in gaining the supplies he so much needed for the
    forlorn band he had left behind him on the Illinois. Finally, on the
    very eve of his embarkation from Fort Frontenac, a letter from Tonti
    informed him that most of the men left at Fort Crèvecœur had deserted,
    plundered the fort, and destroyed all the arms, goods, etc., which they
    could not carry away with them; and this was followed by a letter from
    two friendly lake traders which told him that the deserters had also
    destroyed his fort at St. Joseph, seizing a quantity of furs belonging
    to him at Michilimackinac,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and plundered the magazine at Niagara;
    and that, largely reinforced by others, they were seeking him along
    the northern shore of Lake Ontario, with the design of killing him, if
    they met, in order to escape punishment for their misdeeds. La Salle’s
    courage rose promptly to the occasion. Choosing nine of his trustiest
    men, he started out, in canoes, to face them, met and captured four of
    them in one canoe and killed two and captured three others in another
    canoe. His prisoners he placed in custody at Fort Frontenac, to await
    the coming of Governor-General Frontenac; and immediately put out on
    his return to the Illinois, and the relief of his gallant lieutenant
    Tonti. He took with him a new lieutenant, one La Forest, a surgeon,
    ship-carpenter, joiners, masons, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>soldiers, voyageurs and laborers, 25
    men in all, with full outfits of all needed tools for the building of
    the vessel and a new fort. By a shorter route than that of the previous
    year, they arrived at Michilimackinac, pushed on with 12 men to the
    ruined fort at St. Joseph, where he left the heavy stores, under a
    small guard, to await the arrival of La Forest. His anxiety to reach
    Tonti, of whom, thus far, he had heard nothing, was greatly increased
    by a rumor of an impending invasion of the Illinois country, by the
    Iroquois, which foreboded a new disaster to his enterprise. And as the
    party passed down the Illinois, it met with evidences everywhere that
    the two savage tribes had indeed met in combat, to the utter rout of
    the Illinois; but their anxiety in regard to Tonti was not relieved by
    any word or sign. The vessel, however, which he had left unfinished
    at Fort Crèvecœur was still entire, and but slightly damaged. Once
    more taking to their canoes, they descended the river (250 miles) to
    its junction with the Mississippi, which they first saw about the 7th
    of December, 1681.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> There was now nothing left for him, except to
    retrace his way up the Illinois to relieve the men whom he had left at
    the fort on the St. Joseph.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> And, though to his surprise he learned
    no tidings of Tonti, he found that his men under La Forest’s orders
    had restored the fort, cleared a place for planting, and prepared the
    timber and plank for a new vessel.</p>

  <p>Tonti, meanwhile, finding himself caught in the very midst of the
    terrible war between the Iroquois and the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>Illinois—from which he
    extricated himself and his party only by the supreme exercise of his
    wisdom and courage, against odds almost unsurmountable, had reached
    Lake Michigan, near Chicago, and following its borders northward had
    reached Green Bay, in a starved and half-frozen condition, from which
    they were relieved by a friendly tribe of Pottawatomies. In March, La
    Salle heard of the safety of Tonti, and in May, to their great joy,
    these two brave men were reunited.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

  <p>La Salle passed the winter at his fort on the Miami, on the St.
    Joseph, by the border of Lake Michigan, planning how to meet the old
    disappointments and difficulties which still surrounded him, as well
    as the new contingencies which he foresaw would soon arise. Of these
    latter, the most formidable was the enmity of the ferocious Iroquois
    nation, which had already terrorized the Illinois, and shown a
    disposition to interfere with his own plans. To this end, he conceived
    the idea of a confederation of the Illinois with some of the Western
    tribes, and some from the New England, and Atlantic borders of the
    East, which, under his leadership and the protection of France, would
    be a mutual defense against the incursions of the Iroquois. This bold
    project he speedily carried into effect, by his tact, personal address,
    and superb oratory—for he was a natural-born diplomat, especially in
    all his dealings with Indians. This done he returned to Canada, to
    compose his own disturbed affairs, collect his scattered resources,
    and placate his creditors. By the beginning of autumn he was again on
    his way to complete the task—already twice defeated—of discovering the
    mouth of the Mississippi. For, though he had satisfied himself that it
    really existed, he had still to determine its course, and navigability,
    and the nature of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>its exit into the ocean<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> as well as to acquaint
    himself with its resources, and its savage inhabitants. When he reached
    his fort at the Miami in October, he found there some of his new Indian
    allies from the East, and with 18 of them and 23 of his own Frenchmen,
    started for the headwaters of the Illinois—dragging their canoes and
    baggage on sledges, as the streams were frozen. They reached the
    Mississippi on the 6th of February, launched their little fleet of
    canoes, and—delayed a few days by floating ice—resumed their course,
    passing successively the mouths of the Missouri, the Ohio, and the
    Arkansas rivers, and making visits to many tribes along their course,
    by whom they were well received. As they reached the end of their
    journey, on the 6th of April, sixty-two days from the time of entering
    the river, they saw that the river divided into three broad channels,
    or mouths, of which La Salle followed the western one, Dautray the
    eastern, and Tonti the middle one.</p>

  <p>After La Salle had located, in his canoe, the nearby borders of the
    great sea, or gulf (of Mexico) which spread before them, the three
    parties reassembled (April 9th, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>1682) at a spot where a column was
    erected and near it a plate was buried bearing the arms inscribed with
    the words of France, and “<i lang="fr">Louis Le Grande, Roy de France et de
    Navarre, Règne, Le Neuvième, Avril,</i> 1682.” Then while the <i lang="la">Te
    Deum</i>, the <i lang="la">Exaudéat</i> and the <i lang="la">Domine Salvum fac Regem</i>
    were chanted, the volleys of musketry discharged by the men under arms,
    with cries of “Vive le Roi;” a cross was planted beside the column and
    Le Sieur de Salle, sword in hand, proclaimed the new-found territory as
    <em>Louisiana</em>, and Louis <abbr title="14th">XIV</abbr> as its King and rightful Lord.</p>

  <p>The vast domain thus secured, after the manner of those times, to the
    French Crown, extended from the Alleghanies to the Rocky Mountains, and
    from the Rio Grande and the Gulf of Mexico to the farthest springs of
    the Missouri; but the name—Louisiana—which he gave it is now confined
    to a single commonwealth in the great sisterhood of states forming the
    United States of America.</p>

  <p>Now, in the culmination of his triumph he was seized by an illness so
    severe as to threaten his life; and was unable to reach Fort Miami,
    even by slow stages, before August, and to rejoin Tonti, whom he had
    dispatched with news of his success to Canada. It seems to have been
    about this time that he began to abandon the difficult access which he
    had hitherto found, through Canada, with all its dangers and enemies,
    both whites and Indians; and to reach the region of his hopes and
    toils more directly by way of the Gulf of Mexico and the mouth of the
    Mississippi. His plans of descending that river by means of a vessel
    had twice been thwarted by disasters which proved its futility; and to
    attempt his purpose with canoes would be fraught with much difficulty
    and an enormous expense. He purposed now, in view of all his past
    experiences, to form on the banks of the Illinois a colony of French
    and Indians, as a place of storage of the furs which could be gathered
    by the various Western tribes; and as a defense against the Iroquois,
    who were alike inimical to the French and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> Illinois allies. And
    rumors of an impending renewal of attack upon these allies urged him
    to greater speed; so he and Tonti repaired at once to “Starved Rock,”
    before mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> This was a cliff, rising to a height of 125 feet,
    on the southern bank of the Illinois, presenting on three sides a sheer
    perpendicular wall, and on its other side a deep ravine; and it was
    accessible only by a difficult climb from behind. Its area was about an
    acre. This rock, in December, 1662, they cleared of the forest which
    crowned it, dragged timber up the ragged pathway, built storehouses and
    dwellings, and surrounded the summit with palisades. In this eyrie,
    which he christened Fort St. Louis of the Illinois, the winter was
    passed by La Salle’s company, and by tactful management he secured the
    friendship of the neighboring tribes.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

  <p>Around and under the protection of this fortification was soon gathered
    a motley gathering of the Illinois, and fragments of other tribes, all
    looking to him as their feudal lord; and to these followers, by virtue
    of his seigniorial rights, he began to grant parcels of land, and soon
    had the <i lang="la">nucleus</i> of a colony of some 20,000 souls, numbering
    about 4,000 warriors.</p>

  <p>But, while thus engaged in the wilderness, matters in Canada were
    looming up adversely to his interests. His friend and patron, Count
    Frontenac, had been recalled to France, and the man who succeeded
    him as Governor-General, one de La Barre, was prejudiced against the
    explorer and constantly misrepresenting him to the home government
    in France. Furthermore, emboldened by the tone of the King’s letter,
    who had been led to condemn La Salle’s doings and plans, La Barre,
    with other associates, seized Fort Frontenac (which was La Salle’s
    property), despite the remonstrances of the creditors and mortgagees;
    sold his stores for their own benefit, and turned his cattle <span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>to
    pasture on the growing crops. The position of La Salle became
    intolerable, cut off from his supplies, for which he entreated Governor
    La Barre in vain, threatened with an onslaught of the Iroquois, and
    unable to afford his own Indian allies the help which he had promised
    them, he had no other resource than to leave his wilderness colony in
    faithful Tonti’s care, and cross the ocean again to face his enemies
    before the Court and King.</p>

  <p><i>La Salle’s third return visit to France.</i> So, early in the autumn
    of 1683, he again turned his face homeward. Quite to his surprise, as
    we may well imagine, La Salle found that the time of his return was
    fortuitous. His old friends rallied around him; his enemies seemed, for
    the moment, to have lost their influence against him. Best of all, both
    the King and his Ministers were in better humor with him than, from
    the tone of recent home correspondence, he had reason to expect. The
    country was now at war with Spain, and the trend of official opinion
    chimed in very happily with the proposals which he had to offer for the
    consideration of King and Ministry.</p>

  <p>These proposals were (1) to establish a fortified post upon the Gulf of
    Mexico, within one year after his arrival there; (2) to fortify on the
    Mississippi, about fifty leagues above its mouth, and there collect an
    army of over 15,000 Indians; thus commanding the whole river valley,
    and forming a base for military operations against the Spaniards in
    the most northern province of Mexico. His plan also embraced the
    adding (on his way) 50 buccaneers at St. Domingo, and 4,000 Indian
    warriors from his Fort St. Louis on the Illinois. For this design, he
    asked for a vessel of 30 guns, a few cannon for the forts, and 200
    men, to be raised in France, armed, paid, and maintained at the King’s
    expense. If, by peace with Spain, he was prevented for more than three
    years from the full execution of this contract, he bound himself to
    refund to the Crown all the costs of the enterprise, or forfeit the
    government of the posts thus established. The scheme which he thus
    outlined to the French monarch and his Minister Seignelay,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> of bidding
    defiance to Spanish incursions, and of controlling the entire trade
    and colonization of the entire Mississippi valley, was most gladly and
    promptly accepted by them. La Forest, La Salle’s lieutenant, being
    then in Paris, was dispatched to Canada, empowered to recover and
    reoccupy, in La Salle’s name, the Forts Frontenac and St. Louis of the
    Illinois, from which he had been dispossessed by Governor La Barre;
    and to the latter the King personally wrote, ordering him to restore
    to La Salle, or his representative, all the property of which he had
    been unjustly deprived. As to the equipment of the expedition, he was
    given four vessels, instead of the two for which he had asked, viz.,
    the <cite>Joly</cite>, a 36-gun ship of the royal navy, a 6-gun ship, a
    store-ship, and a ketch. Soldiers were enrolled, besides 30 volunteers,
    many of whom were gentlemen and of the better class of the bourgeois;
    several families, and girls matrimonially inclined, as colonists;
    together with pilots, mechanics, laborers, and six friars and priests
    of the Sulpitian and Récollet orders.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the expedition, from the first, was hampered with a
    divided command. La Salle’s request had been for its sole command,
    with a subaltern officer, one or two pilots, and entire control of
    the route they should take, and of the troops and colonists on land.
    But the command of the ships was given, by the Minister, to one
    Beaujeu, an old and experienced officer of the royal navy—and even
    before the expedition set sail, a collision of opinions and authority
    arose between the two heads of the expedition, which imperiled its
    success.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

  <p>Finally, on the 24th of July, 1684, the expedition sailed, from
    Rochelle. Its further history is to be found in the following pages of
    Joutel’s Journal.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Henri Joutel</span>, the writer of this narrative, was a native
    of Rouen, in France. His father had formerly been head-gardener to
    Henri Cavelier, the uncle of René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle,
    the explorer, whose presence and projects for a new voyage to the
    Mississippi were the engrossing subjects of interest to his fellow
    townsmen of Rouen just at the time of Joutel’s return from a seventeen
    years’ service in the army.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

  <p>Being then in the prime of his young manhood, of an adventurous
    spirit, unhampered by family responsibilities, and free for any new
    employment, he very naturally became a volunteer in the enterprise
    of his distinguished fellow-townsman. He evidently possessed a fair
    education for that day, and a character for reliability and experience,
    which, together with his personal and business qualifications, rendered
    him most acceptable to La Salle’s projected undertaking. His social
    position in his native town, if we may infer from the title of “Mr.”
    usually prefixed to his name, was that of a <i lang="fr">bourgeois</i>—that class
    in the community which for centuries has been the mainstay and source
    of France’s stability and prosperity. In the mixed military and naval
    expedition which sailed under La Salle’s orders, his position seems
    not to have been that of a commissioned officer, though he styles
    himself in his Journal, “a Commander,” but rather that of a personal
    lieutenant <span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>and confidant<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> of the Commander-in-Chief—in other words,
    a superintendent of such matters as pertained to the provisioning,
    sheltering, and general care and regulation of the interests and
    comfort of the settlers, both male and female, who formed a part of the
    expedition.</p>

  <p>His services to the enterprise of which he, fortunately, became the
    historian, as they are simply and circumstantially narrated in this
    Journal, and corroborated by contemporary evidence, prove that La
    Salle’s choice of him, as “the man of affairs” of the expedition was
    well-founded and fortunate. Practical, methodical, resourceful in
    every emergency, tactful in his dealings with all the members of the
    heterogeneous company with whom he was associated, and inflexibly loyal
    to his Chief, Joutel fully proved his worth.</p>

  <p>Twice, at least, his life was in danger, from the machinations of
    mutineers. The first time, the plot was discovered in time, and, having
    received an order to join La Salle with all his force, he delivered
    the criminals to the latter. And again, being left in charge of the
    Fort St. Louis, with 34 men, Joutel was disturbed by a plot to kill
    him or deprive him of his office—from which once more his life, which
    ultimately proved so valuable to the party, was preserved.</p>

  <p>His Journal, here printed, is valuable from its exactness of detail,
    and the fact that, in many places, it corrects the careless or
    misleading statements of others, and it is remarkably free from the
    egotism which disfigures or weakens the narratives of some early
    travelers in America. Parkman, comparing it with other accounts written
    by survivors of the expedition, says emphatically, “It gives the
    impression of sense, intelligence and candor, throughout.”</p>

  <p>No shadow of complicity in the murder of La Salle attaches to
    Joutel. That he did not more strongly assert himself in the critical
    emergencies which succeeded that tragical event, was due, probably, to
    a combination of circumstances. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>The mutineers who had accomplished the
    deed were overwhelmingly dominant, and the lives of the whole party
    trembled in the balance. Joutel was no coward; but the situation in
    which they found themselves called for the exercise of that prudence
    which is ofttimes the better part of valor. Neither was he ambitious,
    so that, when the little band of seven who sought to separate
    themselves from the assassins, finally started upon their long and
    perilous journey toward the North, we find, as if by common consent,
    that the Abbe Cavelier figures as the nominal leader. Undoubtedly, this
    was due partly to the respect felt by Joutel for the aged ecclesiastic
    by virtue of his sacred office, as well as by his own life-long
    association, at Rouen, with the family of Cavelier; and also by motives
    of policy in thus securing for the party the <i lang="fr">prestige</i> of being
    headed by a La Salle—a “name to conjure with” amid the savage tribes
    through whom they must pass.</p>

  <p>Yet, undoubtedly, it was mainly to Joutel’s prudence, courage, and
    practical knowledge that the little band of survivors—after their
    marvelous journey of over 800 miles through trackless wilds, and amid
    innumerable dangers from flood, disease, and savages—finally reached
    Quebec, and ultimately their beloved France, in October, 1688.</p>

  <p>The motives previously alluded to as influencing Joutel in waiving his
    right to the leadership of the party, on its return to civilization,
    may, probably, sufficiently account for (even if they do not fully
    condone) his connivance (as also that of Father Douay) in the
    concealment, for over two years, of the fact of La Salle’s death—a
    deception undoubtedly originating with the Abbe Cavalier, who desired
    thereby to get possession of property which might otherwise have been
    seized by creditors of his deceased brother the Sieur Robert La Salle,
    the explorer. Parkman says (<i>note</i> to p. 207, vol. <abbr title="2">ii</abbr>, <cite>La
    Salle’s Voyages</cite>, Champlain edition) that “the prudent Abbe died
    rich and very old, at the home of a relative, having inherited a large
    estate after his return from America.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

  <p>Joutel appears to have spent the rest of his life at Rouen, where
    Charlevoix says he saw him in 1723; and speaks of him as a very upright
    man, and evidently the only trustworthy member of La Salle’s party. Of
    Joutel’s <cite>Journal</cite> he also speaks in the same strain.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

  <p class="italics">The Manuscript of this Journal hapning to fall into my Hands,
    and having shewn it to some Persons well vers’d in these Affairs,
    they were of Opinion it deserv’d to be printed; especially at this
    Time, when travels are so much in Request, and in regard this is now
    seasonable, on Account of the Description it gives of the famous
    River <em>Missisipi</em> and of the Country of <em>Louisiana</em>, where
    it is intended to make great Settlements. Besides, this Relation is
    uncommon, curious and ingaging, both in Regard to the Honour and
    Advantage of the Nation, for as much as it contains the Attempts and
    the bold and glorious Undertakings of our <em>French</em> Adventurers,
    who not satisfied, like others, with discovering the Borders and Coasts
    of unknown Countries, proceed to penetrate into the Inland, through a

    thousand Dangers and Hazards of their Lives. Is it not very commendable
    in them, to make us fully acquainted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> with that great remaining Part of
    the World, which for so many Ages continued unknown to our Forefathers,
    till about two hundred Years ago <em>Christopher Columbus</em> discover’d
    it, and <em>Americus Vespusius</em> going over soon after, gave it his
    Name, causing it to be call’d <em>America</em>? One of those whom I
    desired to peruse this Manuscript, has a little polish’d it, pursuant
    to the Orders I receiv’d; and he having been a considerable Traveller,
    was a proper Person to judge of and put it into a Dress fit to appear
    in publick. The Letter he writ to me, being not only instructive, in
    Relation to the Journal, but of Use as a curious Supplement to it, I
    thought the inserting of it would be acceptable. It is as follows.</p>

  <div class="ml5"><span class="gesperrt2"><i>SIR</i></span>,</div>

  <p>I Return you your Manuscript; the Reading of it has reviv’d
    the Satisfaction I once took in my Travels; it has oblig’d me
    to read over again those of several Persons, who have writ of
    <i>Canada</i>, and carry’d me in Imagination through those vast,
    barbarous and unknown Countries, with much more Ease and less
    Danger than was done by the Hero of this Relation. He certainly
    deserves that honourable Title, and having read his Adventures, I
    could not forbear saying with the Poet</p>

  <p>For what an extraordinary Strength, what a Vigour of Body and Mind
    was requisite for him to project, to undertake and to go thro’ with
    so unusual, so bold and so difficult an Enterprize. A Discovery of
    above eight hundred Leagues of barbarous and unknown Countries,
    without any beaten Roads, without Towns, and without any of those
    Conveniencies, which render Travelling more easy in all other
    Parts. All the Land-Carriage is reduc’d to walking afoot; being
    often without any other Shoes but a Piece of a Bullock’s Hide
    wrapp’d about the Feet; carrying a Firelock,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> a Snapsack,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Tools
    and some Commodities to barter with the Natives. It is true that
    accidentally and but very rarely a Horse is found to help out a
    little.</p>

  <p>If they must venture upon the Water, there are only some wretched
    Canoes, made either of the Barks of Trees or of Bullocks Hides, and
    those they must often carry or drag along the Land, when the Falls
    of the Rivers obstruct making use of them. All the Bed is lying
    on the bare Ground, exposed to the Inclemencies of the Air, to be
    devour’d by Alligators and bit by Rattle Snakes; without Bread,
    Wine, Salt and all other Comforts of Life, and this for some Years.
    The Diet altogether consists in a poor Pap or Hasty-Pudding made of
    the Meal of <i>Indian</i> Corn, Fish half broil’d or ill boil’d,
    and some Beef or wild Goats Flesh, dry’d in the Air and Smoke.
    Besides, what a Trouble is it to invent Signs to be understood by
    so many several Nations, each of which has it’s peculiar Language?
    All this an Adventurer must resolve with himself to go through, who
    designs to make Discoveries in <i>Canada</i>; and it would be hard
    to believe this, did not all those who write of it exactly agree in
    this Particular.</p>

  <p>However that Country is good and pleasant, at least towards the
    South, which is what is here spoken of. The Temperature of the
    Climate is admirable, the Soil excellent for Tillage, and it
    is extraordinary fertil in all Sorts of Grain and Fruit; which
    appears by those the Land produces of it self in great Plenty.
    The Hills and Woods produce Timber for all Uses and Fruit Trees,
    as well of cold as hot Countries. There are Vines which want but
    little Improvement; there are Sugar-Canes, large Meadows, and
    navigable Rivers full of Fish. It is true they are infested with
    Alligators, but with a little Care they are to be avoided; as may
    the Rattle-Snakes, which are extraordinary venomous, but never
    bite unless they are hurt. There are thousands of wild Bullocks,
    larger than ours, their Flesh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span> good, and instead of Hair, they have
    a Sort of curl’d Wool extraordinary fine. There are Abundance of
    Deer, wild Goats and all Sorts of wild Fowl, and more especially of
    Turkeys. As there are Poisons and Venoms, so there are immediate
    and wonderful Antidotes.</p>

  <p>We must not look there for rich and stately Cities, or lofty
    Structures, or any of those Wonders of Architecture, or the Remains
    and ancient Monuments of the Vanity of great Men; but we may there
    admire Nature in its beautiful Simplicity, as it came from the
    Hands of its Creator; without having been alter’d or depraved by
    Ambition or Art.</p>

  <p>But is so vast and so beautiful a Country only for Beasts, Birds
    and Fishes! O inconceivable Wonder! There is an infinite Number
    of People, divided into Nations, living in Cottages made of the
    Barks of Trees, or cover’d with Reeds or Hides, when they are not
    abroad at War, or Hunting, or Fishing, almost naked, without any
    other Bed but a Bullock’s Hide, or any Houshold-Stuff but a Pot
    or Kettle, an Axe and some Platters made of Bark. They take their
    Sustenance, as it comes in their Way, and like the Beasts; they
    have no Care, do not value Wealth, sing, dance, smoke, eat, sleep,
    hunt, fish; are independent, make War, and when an Opportunity
    offers, take Revenge of any Injury in the most cruel Manner they
    are able. Such is the Life of those Savages. Tho’ there be some in
    the Southern Parts, not quite so stupid and brutal as those in the
    North, yet they are both Savages, who think of Nothing but what is
    present, love Nothing but what is obvious to the Senses, incapable
    of comprehending any Thing that is Spiritual; sharp and ingenious
    in what is for their own Advantage, without any Sense of Honour
    or Humanity; horribly cruel, perfectly united among themselves to
    their Nation and their Allies; but revengeful and merciless towards
    their Enemies. To conclude, their Shape, tho’ hideous, shews they
    are Men; but their Genius and Manners render them like the worst of
    Beasts.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">La <em>Hontan’s</em> forged Discourse with a Savage,
    wherein he renders himself ridiculous.</span>A modern Author, who has liv’d in <i>Canada</i>, and in other
    Respects has writ well enough, has perhaps fancy’d, he might
    distinguish himself, and be thought more understanding than other
    Men in discovering the Genius of those People, by assigning more
    Ingenuity and Penetration to the Savages, than is generally
    allow’d them. He sometimes makes them to argue too strongly and
    too subtilely against the Mysteries of Christian Religion, and his
    Relation has given just Occasion to suspect, that he is himself
    the Libertine and Talking Savage, to whom he has given the artful
    Malignity of his Notions and Arguments.</p>

  <p>As for the Genius of the Savages, I am of Opinion, we ought
    to believe the Missioners; for they are not less capable than
    other Men to discover the Truth, and they have at least as much
    Probity to make it known. It is likely, that they, who have for
    an hundred Years past, wholly apply’d themselves, according to
    the Duty of their Function, to study those poor Images of Men,
    should not be acquainted with them? Or would not their Conscience
    have check’d them, had they told a Lye in that Particular? Now
    all the Missioners agree, that allowing there are some Barbarians
    less wicked and brutal than the rest; yet there are none good,
    nor thoroughly capable of such Things as are above the Reach of
    our Senses; and that whatsoever they are, there is no relying on
    them;<span class="sidenote">The Natives of <em>Canada</em> brutal.</span>
    there is always cause to suspect them, and in short, before
    a Savage can be made a Christian, it is requisite to make him a
    Man; and we look upon those Savages as Men, who have neither King
    nor Law, and what is most deplorable, no God; for if we rightly
    examine their Sentiments and their Actions, it does not appear
    that they have any Sort of Religion, or well form’d Notion of a
    Deity. If some of them, upon certain Occasions, do sometimes own
    a First or Sovereign Being, or do pay some Veneration to the Sun.
    As to the first Article, they deliver themselves in such a confuse
    Manner, and with so many Contradictions and Extravagancies, that it
    plainly appears, they neither <span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>know nor believe anything of it; and
    as for the second, it is only a bare Custom, without any serious
    Reflection on their Part.</p>

  <p>A miserable Nation, more void of the Light of Heaven, and even that
    of Nature, than so many other Nations in the <i>East Indies</i>,
    who, tho’ brutal and stupid as to the Knowledge of the Deity, yet
    are not without some Sort of Worship, and have their Hermits and
    <i>Fakirs</i> who endeavour by the Practice of horrid Penances, to
    gain the Favour of that Godhead, and thereby shew they have some
    real Notion of it. Nothing of that Sort is to be found among our
    <i>American</i> Savages, and in Conclusion, it may be said of them
    in General, that they are a People without a God.</p>

  <p>Our <i>French</i>, who are born in Canada all of them well shap’d,
    and Men of Sense and Worth, cannot endure to have their Savages
    thus run down. They affirm they are like other Men, and only want
    Education and being improv’d; but besides that we may believe they
    say so to save the Honour of their Country, we advance nothing here
    but what is grounded on the Report of many able and worthy Persons,
    who have writ of it, after being well inform’d on the Spot. We are
    therefore apt to believe, that there is a Distinction to be made at
    present between two Sorts of Savages in <i>Canada</i>, <i>viz.</i>
    those who have been conversant among the Europeans for sixty or
    eighty Years past, and the others who are daily discover’d; and it
    is of the latter that we speak here more particularly, and to whom
    we assign all those odious and wretched Qualities of the Savages of
    <i>North America</i>; for it is well known, that the first Sort of
    them, as for Instance, the <i>Hurons</i>, the <i>Algonquins</i>,
    the <i>Iroquois</i>, the <i>Illinois</i> and perhaps some others
    are now pretty well civiliz’d, so that their Reason begins to clear
    up, and they may become capable of Instruction.</p>

  <p>Amazing and incomprehensible, but at the same Time adorable
    Disposition of Divine Providence! We see here a vast Tract of the
    Earth, of an immense Extent, of a wonderful Soil for Tillage and
    Fertility in all Sorts of Fruit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
    and Grain; of an admirable Temperature as to the Air, which appears by
    the very numerous Inhabitants being scarce subject to any Diseases, and
    in that the Sex, which among us is weak, is there Strong and Vigorous,
    <span class="sidenote">Strong Women.</span>
    bringing forth their Children with little or no Pain, and suckling
    them amidst Labour and Fatigues, without any of those Miseries they
    are liable to in our Countries. Yet that vast and beautiful Country,
    describ’d in this Journal, so much favour’d with Worldly Blessings, has
    been for so many Ages destitute of the Heavenly.</p>

  <p>The infinite Numbers of People inhabiting it are Men, and have scarce
    any thing but the Shape; they are God’s Creatures, and do not so much
    as know, much less serve him. Those who have the Courage and Boldness
    to travel through the Countries of such Savages, and those who read
    the Relations of such Travellers, ought to take Care how they make
    any rash Reflections upon this Point, or pry too deeply into it; for
    they may chance to lose themselves in their Thoughts. The shortest
    and the safest Course is, in such Cases, to adore the inconceivable
    Profoundness of the Creator’s Wisdom; to give a Check to all our
    Enquiries and Curiosities, with the Apostle’s Exclamation, <i>O the
    Depth of the Riches both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God! How
    unsearchable are his Judgments and his Ways past finding out!</i>
    And never ceasing to return Thanks to his Goodness, for having so
    abundantly supply’d us with his Light and Grace, to conjure him to
    impart the same to those poor distress’d <i>Americans</i>, and that he
    who is Almighty, will of those Stones make Children of <i>Abraham</i>.
    This all Christians are oblig’d incessantly to pray for, because as
    Brutish and Stupid as those Savages are, they are still our Brethren,
    since like us descended from <i>Adam</i> and <i>Noah</i>.</p>

  <p>How much are we then oblig’d to those bold Travellers, who undertake
    new Discoveries, who to the Hazard of their Lives, at their own
    Expence, and with such extraordinary Toils, go to find out for us,
    not only numerous Objects of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> our Curiosity and Admiration, which
    were before unknown to us, but who also discover to us a numerous
    Kindred, which is not ever the less such, for having been so long
    unknown to us. What if it be brutal and indocible, it will be the
    more Meritorious to Labour at Civilizing of and making it capable of
    receiving the Lights of Reason and of Faith. We can never sufficiently
    express our Gratitude to those who apply themselves to the making of
    new Discoveries; the more Difficulties that attend them, the more we
    are beholding to those who undertake them. Supposing that Avarice,
    Ambition, a restless Temper, or a desperate Fortune, are very often the
    Occasions of such Undertakings; yet God, who can draw Good out of Evil,
    makes all those Passions subservient to his Glory, and the Salvation
    of his Elect, and if long Travels do not commonly make Saints of the
    Travellers, it is their own Fault. However, they at least prepare the
    Way to the Sanctification of so many Barbarians, beating a Road for
    the Missioners, who go to instruct those People. Thus all the World is
    beholden to them; the Savages for the Knowledge of God that is procur’d
    them; and we for finding by their Means an infinite Number of People
    before unknown, who will join with us in Serving and Glorifying the
    Creator of the Universe.</p>

  <p>Granting that the said Travellers are not sometimes exact, or agree
    among themselves in their Relations, their Descriptions and their
    Maps; this must be an unavoidable Fault in Discoverers; but even that
    is advantageous to the Publick, for as much as their Successors are
    excited to examine those Points more strictly, to correct, explain and
    ascertain those Mistakes.</p>

  <p>In acknowledgment therefore of the Service done us by those Illustrious
    Adventurers and to make them some Sort of Amends for their Sufferings,
    let us transmit their Names to Posterity in our Writings; let us
    applaud their Actions when we read them, and let us commend their
    Relations. This here, most certainly deserves to be read and commended,
    for it is Curious, Extraordinary and Tragical. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span> is also, as has been
    said before, ingaging, at this Conjuncture, when there is a Design of
    making Settlements in those Countries, it mentions, the Consequence
    whereof may be most Honourable and Advantageous to the Nation. The
    Travel thro’ that Country is one of the greatest and most full of
    Difficulties that has been perform’d; the Relation of it being made
    by an Eye Witness, and in a natural, plain and particular Manner,
    deserves to be credited; but being only a Journal, it is not capable of
    admitting of Ornaments or Embellishments. The Reader will be pleas’d
    to excuse the Repetition of the same Words in it, on Account of the
    Impossibility of doing otherwise, and will think it enough that the
    Barrenness of the Narration is made Amends for by the Curiosity of the
    Subjects. I am of Opinion the small Notes I have added will not be
    displeasing, because they explain some Particulars, which are not very
    intelligible to such as are not us’d to read many Travels.</p>

  <p>After having said the Good and the Bad of this <i>North America</i>,
    mentioning the Beauty and Excellency of its Climate and the Brutality
    of its People, and recited the infinite Hardships, those who design
    to travel must resolve to undergo, I am of Opinion it will be proper
    to say something of the late Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, who is the
    principal Person, and as it were, the Hero of this Relation, tho’
    having been murdered by his own Men, he fell the unfortunate Victim of
    the Discovery here treated of. It is also convenient to make known what
    went before that, which is contain’d in this Journal, and the present
    happy Consequence of that fatal Enterprize. Here follows what I have of
    my own particular Knowledge, and by what has been written.</p>

  <p><i>Robert Cavelier</i>, commonly call’d<span class="sidenote">Account of Monsieur <em>de la Sale</em>.</span> Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>,
    a Native of <i>Roan</i>, of a good Family, having been educated in
    Piety and Learning, went over very young into <i>Canada</i> and took
    Delight in Trade, but more in Projects of new Discoveries up the Inland
    of those vast Countries. Intending to settle there and make that his
    Country, he purchased an Habitation in the Island of <i>Mont-real</i>,
    where has been built<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> the second Town of <i>Canada</i>, sixty Leagues
    above <i>Quebeck</i>, which is the Capital, being also a Bishoprick,
    and the Residence of the Governor, the Intendant and the supreme
    Council. There are but only those two Towns in the Country, besides
    some Villages. They are both seated on the great River of St.
    <i>Laurence</i>, which coming from the S. W. is form’d or increased by
    the Waters of five prodigious fresh Water Lakes, running out one into
    another, and through them it passes to run down to discharge itself
    in the Ocean, at a very spacious Mouth, making Way for the Ships that
    design to penetrate into <i>Canada</i>.</p>

  <p>Many Discoveries had been made to the Northward, before Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale’s</i> Time; because there being Plenty of very good
    Furs, the Traders of <i>Quebeck</i> and <i>Mont-real</i>, by Means
    of the Adventurers call’d <i>Wood-Men</i>,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> from their traveling
    thro’ the Woods, had penetrated very far up the Country that Way; but
    none had advanc’d far towards the South or South-West, beyond Fort
    <i>Frontenac</i>, which is on the Lake <i>Ontario</i>, the nearest this
    Way of the five great Lakes. However, upon the Report of the Natives,
    it was supposed, that great and advantageous Discoveries might be made.
    There had been much Talk of the rich Mines of St. <i>Barbara</i>, in
    the Kingdom of <i>Mexico</i>, and some were tempted to give them a
    Visit.</p>

  <p>Something was known of the famous River <i>Missisipi</i>, which it was
    supposed might fall into the South Sea, and open a Way to it. These
    Conjectures working upon Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, who being zealous
    for the Honour of his Nation,<span class="sidenote">His Character.</span> designed to signalize the <i>French</i>
    Name, on Account of extraordinary Discoveries, beyond all that went
    before him; he form’d the Design and resolv’d to put it in Execution.
    He was certainly very fit for it, and succeeded at the Expense of his
    Life; for no Man has done so much in that Way as he did for the Space
    of twenty Years he spent in that Employment. He was a Man of a regular
    Behaviour, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>of a large Soul, well enough learned, and understanding in
    the Mathematicks, designing, bold, undaunted, dexterous, insinuating,
    not to be discourag’d at any Thing, ready at extricating himself out
    of any Difficulties, no Way apprehensive of the greatest Fatigues,
    wonderful steady in Adversity, and what was of extraordinary Use,
    well enough versed in several Savage Languages. M. <i>de la Sale</i>
    having such extraordinary Talents, whereof he had given sufficient
    Proofs upon several Occasions, gain’d the Esteem of the Governors of
    <i>Canada</i>; and Messieurs <i>de Courcelles</i>, <i>Talon</i> and
    <i>de Frontenac</i> successively express’d the same, by often employing
    him in Affairs for the Honour and Advantage of the Colony.</p>

  <p>The Government<span class="sidenote">Is made Proprietor of Fort <em>Frontenac</em>.</span> of the Fort of <i>Frontenac</i>, which is the Place
    farthest advanc’d among the Savages, was committed to him, and he going
    over into <i>France</i>, in the Year 1675, the King made him Proprietor
    of it, upon Condition he should put it into a better Condition than
    it was, which he did, as soon as return’d to <i>Canada</i>. Then came
    back again to <i>Paris</i>, full of the new Informations he had gain’d
    touching the River <i>Missisipi</i>, the Country runs through, the
    Mines, especially those of Lead and Copper, the navigable Rivers, and
    the Trade that might be carried on of Furs and the fine Wooll of those
    wild Bullocks, whereof there are infinite Numbers in the Forests.
    Being also furnish’d with better Accounts of that Country, than the
    Fables that were then publish’d, by the Name of a Voyage of the Sieur
    <i>Joliet</i>, he was well receiv’d at Court, and dispatch’d with the
    necessary Orders for proceeding on his Discoveries.</p>

  <p>The great Reputation<span class="sidenote">His Reputation makes Enemies.</span> Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had gain’d, and his
    mighty Projects, occasion’d a Jealousy in some and Envy in others.
    His own Countrymen thwarted his Designs; but he surmounted all those
    Obstacles and return’d into <i>Canada</i>, about the Year 1678, with
    the Chevalier <i>Tonty</i>, an <i>Italian</i> Gentleman, a Person
    of Worth and that had serv’d, whom he gain’d to his Enterprize. He
    also pick’d up in the Country forty or fifty Persons fit for that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
    Expedition, and among them were three Recolets, whom he carry’d over
    to try what might be done as to Christianity among the Savages; he
    was well acquainted with, and had a just Esteem for the Virtue, the
    Capacity and the Zeal of those good, religious Men, who alone first
    undertook the Mission into that new World, and who being seconded by
    others, have carry’d it on there, with so much Edification.</p>

  <p>Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> having spent two Years in going and coming,
    still thwarted by those who envy’d him in the Country, to such a
    Degree, that had it not been for an Antidote, he must have dy’d of
    Poison given him by some Villains, could not order his Affairs and
    begin his Expedition till the Year 1682. He set out at length, and
    to the End his Discovery of the <i>Missisipi</i> might be compleat,
    he caus’d Father <i>Hennepin</i>, a Recolet, with some others, to
    travel to the Northward, that they might find out the<span class="sidenote">Source of the <em>Missisipi</em>.</span> Source of that
    River, and they found it, about the 50th Degree of North Latitude.
    For his own Part, he proceeded to the Westward and found the River of
    the <i>Islinois</i>,<span class="sidenote"><em>Islinois</em> River.</span> which he call’d the River of <i>Seignelay</i>,
    and following its Course, came into the <i>Missisipi</i>, where the
    other discharges it self. He then concluded he had no more to do,
    but to run down to its Mouth, whether in the South Sea or the Gulph
    of <i>Mexico</i>. All along its Banks he found many Savage Nations,
    with whom, by Means of his Presents, he enter’d into Alliances, and
    gave the Country the Name of <i>Louisiana</i>, to honour the Name
    and Memory of our August Monarch, in whose Reign those Discoveries
    were made. At length, the Course of the <i>Missisipi</i> convey’d
    Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> to its Mouths, as falling into the Gulph
    of <i>Mexico</i> in two Streams, and he arriv’d there in the Month
    of <i>April</i> 1682 or 1683, for the Dates of those who have writ
    concerning it, make either of those Years. He stay’d there some Days,
    to take Observations and place some Marks which he might know again,
    when he return’d. Being satisfied with having found some Part of what
    he sought, he return’d the same Way he had gone, and came again to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
    <i>Quebeck</i> in <i>Canada</i>, in order to go over to <i>France</i>,
    and thence to make a Tryal to find that Mouth of the <i>Missisipi</i>
    by the Gulph of <i>Mexico</i>, which he had already discover’d by the
    Way of <i>Canada</i>, and to secure it; for he thought it much more
    advantageous to know it by the Way of the Sea, than to go thither by
    Land, because the Voyage through <i>Canada</i> is much longer and
    more troublesome, and can be perform’d but once a Year, whereas by
    the Way of the Bay of <i>Mexico</i> it is not longer, but is much
    more commodious, and may be perform’d in all Seasons, either going or
    coming. He was also sensible that the said Mouth being once discover’d
    by Sea, afforded an easier and safer Communication with <i>Canada</i>,
    running up that noble River, the Navigation whereof is not interrupted
    by Falls, nor Torrents for above sixty Leagues towards its Source.</p>

  <p>These Considerations mov’d Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> to take another
    Voyage into <i>France</i>, where his Expedition having been commended
    and his new Project approv’d of, the King order’d him Vessels to return
    and carry on his Enterprize, the Particulars whereof are to be found
    in this Journal. That Affair, so well begun, seem’d to promise very
    advantageous Consequences; but it miscarried through the Perfidiousness
    and Villany of that noble Adventurer’s own People.</p>

  <p>This<span class="sidenote">The other Part here mention’d is at the End of the
    Journal.</span> is what I have judg’d might serve as an Introduction to your
    Journal, if it shall not be thought to dishonour it, you may place
    it before the said Journal, and that which follows at the End of it,
    which will shew how far that great Enterprize of the Discovery of the
    <i>Missisipi</i> has been carried.</p>

  <p class="italics">Notwithstanding the late Monsieur <em>de la Sale’s</em> Voyage had
    a most unfortunate End, as to his own Person, yet that will not
    hinder Posterity, from ever allowing him the Title of a most renowned
    Traveller.</p>

  <p class="italics">The History of his Enterprize will be acceptable to future Ages, for
    laying before them, the extraordinary Genius, the invincible Courage,
    and the undaunted Resolution of such a Man, who could contrive and
    execute the Means for discovering the remaining Part of the World.</p>

  <p class="italics">And in regard that the Particulars of the Discovery of those large
    and immense Provinces, will always be the Object of curious and
    understanding Persons, it is not to be wonder’d, that after what has
    been writ by Father <em>Hennepin</em>, a Recolet, the Chevalier <em>Tonty</em>
    and some others, we here now publish an Historical Journal of the
    last Voyage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> Monsieur <em>de la Sale</em> undertook into the Gulf of
    <em>Mexico</em>, to the Country of <em>Louisiana</em>, to finish what he had
    projected at his former Voyage, had not the Treachery of his own Men
    cut him off.</p>

  <p class="italics">This Journal of Monsieur <em>Joutel</em>, whereof Monsieur
    <em>Tonty</em> makes mention in the Book that has been printed of the last
    Discoveries in <em>America</em>, Folio 319, has this peculiar, that it
    exactly contains what hap’ned to Monsieur <em>de la Sale</em>, Day by
    Day, in that fatal Voyage, since his Departure from <em>Rochelle</em> to
    his death, and till the Return of his Brother Monsieur <em>Cavelier</em>
    the Priest, Monsieur <em>Cavelier</em> his Nephew, the Reverend
    Father <em>Anastasius</em>, the Recolet, and the said Sieur <em>Joutel</em>,
    who in Order to return to <em>France</em>, took that long Journey by
    Land, from the Gulf of <em>Mexico</em> to <em>Canada</em>, being a Tract of
    above 800 Leagues.</p>

  <p class="italics">Many Adventures of all Sorts, most of which are Tragical, will
    please the curious Reader; and above all he will admire the Protection
    of Divine Providence, in Conducting and Preserving that small Company
    throughout those vast Regions, and among so many barbarous Nations.</p>

  <p class="italics">We do not here pretend to Criticise upon the Work of Father
    <em>Hennepin</em>, or that of Monsieur <em>Tonty</em>; but even their own
    Favourers cannot take it ill, that this Author does not sometimes say
    as they do; that he plainly delivers what he saw, and that he exposes
    to publick View all the Truths he was an Eye Witness to, without
    magnifying or inventing.</p>

  <p class="italics">It is nevertheless true, that they may be all excus’d as to some
    Particulars; Father <em>Hennepin</em> and Monsieur <em>Tonty</em> may have
    seen some Things, that did not come to the Knowledge of Monsieur
    <em>Joutel</em>; but there is a Fact of great Consequence in the History
    of Monsieur <em>de la Sale</em>, which must not be pass’d over in Silence.</p>

  <p class="italics">It is, that Monsieur <em>Tonty</em>, in his Book affirms, that
    Monsieur <em>de la Sale</em> at length found the Mouth of the
    <em>Missisipi</em>, and Monsieur <em>Joutel</em> asserts the contrary, and
    says, that is so far from being true, that during his last Progress
    towards the <em>Cenis</em>, when the said Sieur <em>Joutel</em> was with
    him, and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span> never been parted, Monsieur <em>de la Sale’s</em> principal
    Care was to enquire of all the Nations they pass’d through, where
    the <em>Missisipi</em> was, and could never hear any thing of it; that
    this is evidently made out, because if Monsieur <em>de la Sale</em> had
    found the Mouth of that River, he would infallibly have taken another
    Way, and other Measures, and all the Appearances are on this Side, as
    may be seen in this Relation.</p>

  <p class="italics">However, this must be said in Behalf of Monsieur <em>Tonty</em>, that
    he deliver’d it upon the Report of Monsieur <em>Cavelier</em> the
    Priest, and Brother to Monsieur <em>de la Sale</em>; which Monsieur
    <em>Cavelier</em> might have Reasons to give out they had discover’d the
    <em>Missisipi</em>, upon the same Views as oblig’d him to conceal his
    Brother’s Death.</p>

  <p class="italics">Now in regard we shall see Monsieur <em>de la Sale</em>, for some
    time ranging along the Coasts of North America, to find out the Mouth
    of that River, it will be proper to inform those who have not seen his
    first Voyage, and shew them how it hap’ned that his Search prov’d in
    vain, and he was oblig’d to land in another Place.</p>

  <p class="italics">After Monsieur <em>de la Sale</em> had discover’d that vast Continent,
    which is a Part of <em>North America</em>, from <em>Canada</em>, by the Way
    of <em>Montreal</em>, going up the River of St. <em>Laurence</em>, then
    through the Country of the <em>Iroquois</em>, the <em>Islinois</em> and
    others, all which he call’d <em>Louisiana</em>, his Design was to find a
    shorter and a safer Way, than that he had Travell’d by Land.</p>

  <p class="italics">For this Reason it was, that having upon his first Discovery found
    the great River, call’d by the Barbarians <em>Missisipi</em> or
    <em>Mechasipi</em>, according to Father <em>Hennepin</em>, and to which he gave
    the Name of <em>Colbert</em>, guessing by its Course that it fell into
    the Bay of <em>Mexico</em>, he resolved with himself to find out the
    Mouth of it.</p>

  <p class="italics">In short, he ran down that River, with more Danger and Toil than can
    be imagin’d, found it parted into two Streams and follow’d that which
    was most to the Northward, to the Place where it is lost in the Sea. He
    took the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span> Latitude that Mouth lay in, and found it was between 28 and
    29 Degrees North, as Monsieur <em>Joutel</em> affirms he heard him say.
    He left Marks there, return’d the same Way to <em>Canada</em> and thence
    into <em>France</em>, well pleased with his Discovery, which would have
    been very glorious, had he succeeded in his second Voyage.</p>

  <p class="italics">But whether he did not take his Measures right, when he made his
    Observations ashore, or whether that River disgorges it self at a flat
    Coast, and only leaves some inconsiderable Mark of its Channel for
    such as come by Sea; it is most certain, that when he came into the
    Bay of <em>Mexico</em>, he sought for the same Mouth in Vain, during the
    Space of three Weeks, and was oblig’d to go ashore to the S. W. of the
    Place, where it really was.</p>

  <p class="italics">Monsieur <em>Tonty</em>, in his Book, Fol. 192, tells us, that he was
    present when Monsieur <em>de la Sale</em> took the Latitude of the Mouth
    of the <em>Missisipi</em>, at his first Voyage, and says it was between
    twenty two and twenty three Degrees North; but that is a Mistake, which
    must be assigned either to the Printer, or Transcriber, for in the Map
    the said Monsieur <em>Tonty</em> has added to his Book, he places the
    said Mouth in about twenty six Degrees and a Half of North Latitude,
    and there is Reason to believe he errs in that too.</p>

  <p class="italics">Monsieur <em>Joutel</em> and some others are of Opinion, that the
    Mouth of that Branch Monsieur <em>de la Sale</em> went down, is in the
    Bay of the <em>Holy Ghost</em>, and actually between the twenty eighth
    and twenty ninth Degrees of North Latitude, as Monsieur <em>de la
    Sale</em> found it. As for the other Channel, the same Sieur <em>Joutel</em>
    believes it is farther towards the S. W. and about the Shoals they
    met with about the 6th of <em>January, 1685</em>, between the twenty
    seventh and twenty eighth Degrees of North Latitude, when they were
    sailing along the Coast of the Bay of <em>Mexico</em>, and that those
    Shoals were the Marks of a River discharging it self there, which they
    neglected to inquire into. If that be so, Monsieur <em>de la Sale</em>
    was very near it, and even pass’d along before both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span> the Mouths, but
    unfortunately, without perceiving them, which was the main Cause of his
    Death and the Ruin of his Enterprize.</p>

  <p class="italics">To conclude, it must be granted, that as the Return of that small
    Number of Persons from a Country so remote and through so many Dangers,
    is a visible Effect of the Divine Protection; so it is also an Effect
    of Heavenly Justice to have preserv’d those Witnesses, and to have
    brought them Home into Monsieur <em>de la Sale’s</em> Country, to
    retrieve his Reputation, which had been sully’d by his Enemies.</p>

  <p class="italics">Monsieur <em>de la Sale</em> would have been taken for a Dreamer,
    and even for an Impostor; his Enterprize had been condemn’d, and his
    Memory blasted; but God would not permit the Honour of a Man of such
    singular Merit to suffer; it pleas’d him to preserve and bring Home
    unquestionable Witnesses, who, by Word of Mouth and other undoubted
    Proofs of the notable Discoveries made by Monsieur <em>de la Sale</em>,
    have stopp’d the Mouths of his Enemies, and made out the Truth of
    what has been asserted at the Beginning of this Discourse, <em>viz.</em>
    that Monsieur <em>de la Sale</em> only wanted good Fortune to secure
    him the Title of a great Man and a renowned Traveller.</p>

    At the Time when Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> was preparing for his last
    Voyage into <i>North America</i>, I happen’d to be at <i>Roan</i>, the
    Place where he and I were both born, being return’d from the Army,
    where I had serv’d sixteen or seventeen Years.</p>

  <p>The Reputation gain’d by Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, the Greatness of
    his Undertaking, the Natural Curiosity which all men are possess’d
    with, and my Acquaintance with his Kindred, and with several of the
    Inhabitants of that City,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span> who were to bear him Company, easily
    prevail’d with me to make one of the Number, and I was admitted as a
    volunteer.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">July 1684</span>Our Rendezvous was appointed at <i>Rochel</i>, where we were to
    imbark. Messieurs <i>Cavelier</i>, the one Brother, the other Nephew
    to Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Messieurs <i>Chedeville</i>,
    <i>Planteroze</i>, <i>Thibault</i>, <i>Ory</i>, some others and I,
    repair’d thither in <i>July 1684</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Departure from <em>Rochel</em>.</span>Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> having provided all Things necessary
    for his Voyage, surmounted all the Difficulties laid in his Way by
    several ill-minded Persons, and receiv’d his Orders from Monsieur
    <i>Arnoult</i>, the Intendant at <i>Rochel</i>, pursuant to those
    he had receiv’d from the King, we sail’d on the <i>24th of July,
    1684</i>,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> being twenty four Vessels, four of them for our Voyage,
    and the others for the Islands and <i>Canada</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Persons that went.</span>The four Vessels appointed for Monsieur <i>de la Sale’s</i> Enterprize,
    had on Board about two hundred and eighty persons, including the
    Crews; of which Number there were one hundred Soldiers, with their
    Officers, one <i>Talon</i>, with his <i>Canada</i> Family, about thirty
    Volunteers, some young Women, and the rest hired People and Workmen of
    all Sorts, requisite for making of a Settlement.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Ships.</span>The first of the four Vessels was a Man of War, call’d <cite>le
    Joly</cite>, of about thirty six or forty Guns, commanded by Monsieur
    <i>de Beaujeu</i>, on which Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, his Brother
    the Priest, two Recolet Fryars, Messieurs <i>Dainmaville</i> and
    <i>Chedeville</i>, Priests, and I imbark’d. The next was a little
    Frigate, carrying six Guns, which the King had given to Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i>, commanded by two Masters; a Flyboat of about three
    hundred Tuns Burden, belonging to the Sieur <i>Massiot</i>, Merchant at
    <i>Rochel</i>, commanded by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>the Sieur <i>Aigron</i>, and laden with
    all the Effects Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had thought necessary for
    his Settlement, and a small Ketch, on which Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>
    had imbark’d thirty Tuns of Ammunition, and some Commodities design’d
    for <i>Santo Domingo</i>.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

  <p>All the Fleet, being under the Command of Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i>,
    was order’d to keep together as far as <i>Cape Finisterre</i>, whence
    each was to follow his own Course; but this was prevented by an
    unexpected Accident. We were come into 45 Degrees 23 Minutes of North
    Latitude, and about 50 Leagues from <i>Rochel</i>, when the Boltsprit
    of our Ship, the <cite>Joly</cite>, on a sudden, broke short, which oblig’d
    us to strike all our other Sails, and cut all the Rigging the broken
    <span class="sidenote">Boltsprit lost.</span>Boltsprit hung by.</p>

  <p>Every man reflected on this Accident according to his Inclination.
    Some were of Opinion it was a Contrivance; and it was debated in
    Council, Whether we should proceed to <i>Portugal</i>, or return to
    <i>Rochel</i>, or <i>Rochfort</i>;<span class="sidenote">Return to <em>Rochfort</em>.</span> but the latter Resolution prevail’d.
    The other Ships design’d for the Islands and <i>Canada</i>, parted
    from us, and held on their Course. We made back for the River of
    <i>Rochfort</i>, whither the other three Vessels follow’d us, and
    a Boat was sent in, to acquaint the Intendant with this Accident.
    The Boat returned some Hours after, towing along a Boltsprit, which
    was soon set in its Place, and after Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had
    confer’d with the Intendant, he left that Place on the first of
    <span class="sidenote ul">Aug. 1684</span><i>August, 1684</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote"><em>Cape Finisterre.</em></span>We sail’d again, steering <i>W.</i> and by <i>S.</i> and on the 8th of
    the same Month weather’d <i>Cape Finisterre</i>, which is in 43 Degrees
    of North Latitude, without meeting any Thing remarkable. The 12th, we
    were in the Latitude of <i>Lisbon</i>, or about 39 Degrees North. The
    16th, we were in 36 Degrees, the Latitude of the <i>Streights</i>, and
    the 20th, discover’d the Island <i>Madera</i>,<span class="sidenote"><em>Madera.</em></span> which is in 32 Degrees,
    and where <span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i> propos’d to Monsieur <i>de la
    Sale</i> to anchor, and take in Water and some Refreshments.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Difference between the Commanders.</span>Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> was not of that Mind, on Account that we
    had been but twenty one Days from <i>France</i>, had sufficient Store
    of Water, ought to have taken aboard Refreshments enough, and it would
    be a Loss of eight or ten Days<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> to no Purpose; besides, that our
    Enterprize requir’d Secrecy, whereas the <i>Spaniards</i> might get
    some Information, by Means of the People of that Island, which was not
    agreeable to the King’s Intention.</p>

  <p>This Answer was not acceptable to Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i>, or the
    other Officers, nor even to the Ships Crew, who mutter’d at it very
    much, and it went so far, that a Passenger, call’d <i>Paget</i>, a
    <i>Hugonet</i> of <i>Rochel</i>, had the Insolence to talk to Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i> in a very passionate and disrespectful Manner, so
    that he was fain to make his Complaint to Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i>,
    and ask of him, Whether he had given any Incouragement to such a Fellow
    to talk to him after that Manner. Monsieur <i>Beaujeu</i> made him no
    Satisfaction. These Misunderstandings, with some others which happen’d
    before, being no Way advantageous to his Majesty’s Service, laid the
    Foundation of<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> those tragical Events, which afterwards put an
    unhappy End to Monsieur <i>de la Sale’s</i> Life and Undertaking, and
    occasion’d our Ruin.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Flying Fish.</span>However, it was resolv’d not to come to an Anchor at that Island,
    whereupon Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i> said, That since it was so, we
    should put in no where but at the Island of <i>Santo Domingo</i>. We
    held on our Course, weather’d the Island of <i>Madera</i>, and began
    to see those little flying Fishes, which to escape the <i>Dorados</i>,
    or Gilt-Heads, that pursue them, leap out of the Water, take a little
    Flight of about a Pistol Shot, and then fall again into the Sea, but
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>very often into Ships, as they are sailing by. That Fish is about as
    big as a Herring, and very good to eat.</p>

  <p>On the 24th, we came into the Trade Wind,<span class="sidenote">Trade Wind.</span> which continually blows
    from East to West, and is therefore call’d by some Authors <i>Ventus
    subsolanus</i>, because it follows the Motion of the Sun. The 28th,
    we were in 27 Degrees 44 Minutes<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> of North Latitude, and in 344 of
    Longitude. The 30th, we had a Storm, which continu’d violent for two
    Days, but being right astern of us, we only lost Sight of the Ketch,
    for want of good Steering, but she join’d us again a few Days after.</p>

  <p>The 6th of <i>September</i>,<span class="sidenote ul">Sept. 1684</span> we were under the Tropic of <i>Cancer</i>,
    in 23 Degrees 30 Minutes of North Latitude and 319 of Longitude. There
    Mons. <i>de la Sale’s</i> Obstructing the Ceremony the Sailors call
    Ducking,<span class="sidenote">Ducking.</span> gave them Occasion to mutter again, and render’d himself
    privately odious. So many have given an Account of the Nature of that
    Folly, that it would be needless to repeat it here; it may suffice to
    say, that there are three things to authorize it, 1. Custom. 2. The
    Oath administer’d to those who are duck’d, which is to this Effect,
    <i>That they will not permit any to pass the Tropics or the Line,
    without obliging them to the same Ceremony</i>. And 3, which is the
    most prevailing Argument, the Interest accruing to the Sailors upon
    that Occasion, by the Refreshments, Liquors or Money given them by the
    Passengers to be excus’d from that Ceremony.</p>

  <p>Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i>, being inform’d that all Things were preparing
    for that Impertinent Ceremony of Ducking, and that a Tub full of Water
    was ready on the Deck (<i>the French Duck in a great Cask of Water, the
    English in the Sea, letting down the Person at the Yard Arm</i>)<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
    sent Word, that he would not allow such as were under his Command<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> to
    be subject to that Folly, which being told to Monsr. <i>de Beaujeu</i>,
    he forbid putting of it in Execution, to the great Dissatisfaction of
    the inferior Officers and Sailors, who expected a considerable Sum of
    Money and Quantity of Refreshments, or Liquors, because there were
    many Persons to Duck, and all the Blame was laid upon Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i>.</p>

  <p>On the 11th of <i>September</i>, we were in the Latitude of the Island
    of <i>Santa Domingo</i>, or <i>Hispaniola</i>,<span class="sidenote"><em>Hispaniola</em> Island.</span> being 20 Degrees North,
    and the Longitude of 320 Degrees. We steer’d our Course West, but the
    Wind flatting, the ensuing Calm quite stopp’d our Way. That same Day
    Monsr. <i>Dainmaville</i>, the Priest,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> went aboard the Bark <i>la
    Belle</i>, to administer the Sacraments to a Gunner, who died a few
    Days after. Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i> went to see him, and I bore him Company.</p>

  <p>The 21st,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> the Ketch, which we had before lost sight of, join’d us
    again; and some Complaints being made to Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i>, by
    several private Persons that were aboard the Flyboat, he order’d me to
    go thither to accomodate those Differences, which were occasion’d only
    by some Jealousies among them.</p>

  <p>The 16th, we sail’d by the Island <i>Sombrero</i>,<span class="sidenote"><em>Sombrero</em> Island.</span> and the 18th had
    hard blowing Weather, which made us apprehensive of a Hurracan. The
    foul Weather lasted two Days, during which Time, we kept under a main
    Course and lost Sight of the other Vessels.</p>

  <p>A Council was call’d aboard our Ship, the <cite>Joly</cite>, to consider
    whether we should lie by for the others, or hold on our Course, and
    it was resolv’d, that, considering our Water began to fall short,
    and there were above five Persons<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> sick aboard, of which Number
    Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i> and the Surgeon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span><a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> were, we should make
    all the Sail we could, to reach the first Port<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> of the Island
    <i>Hispaniola</i>, being that call’d <i>Port de Paix</i>, or Port
    Peace, which Resolution was accordingly register’d.</p>

  <p>The 20th, we discover’d the first Land of <i>Hispaniola</i>, being Cape
    <i>Samana</i>,<span class="sidenote">Cape <em>Samana</em>.</span> lying in 19 Degrees of North Latitude, and of Longitude
    308. The 25th we should have put into <i>Port de Paix</i>, as had been
    concerted, and it was not only the most convenient Place for us to
    get Refreshments, but also the Residence of Monsr. <i>de Cussy</i>,
    Governor of the Island <i>Tortuga</i>, who knew that Monsr. <i>de la
    Sale</i> carried particular Orders for him to furnish such Necessaries
    as he stood in Need of.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding these cogent Reasons, Mr. <i>de Beaujeu</i> was
    positive to pass further on in the Night, weathering the Island
    <i>Tortuga</i>,<span class="sidenote"><em>Tortuga</em> Island.</span> which is some Leagues distant from <i>Port de
    Paix</i> and the Coast of <i>Hispaniola</i>. He also pass’d Cape St.
    <i>Nicolas</i>, and the 26th<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> of the said Month, we put into the
    Bay of <i>Jaguana</i>, coasting the Island <i>Guanabo</i>, which is in
    the Middle of that Great Bay or Gulph, and in Conclusion, on the 27th
    we arriv’d at <i>Petit Gouave</i>, having spent 58 Days in our Passage
    from the Port of <i>Chef de Bois</i>, near <i>Rochel</i>.</p>

  <p>This Change of the Place for our little Squadron to put into, for
    which no Reason could be given, prov’d very disadvantageous; and
    it will hereafter appear, as I have before observ’d, that those
    misunderstanding among the Officers insensibly drew on the Causes from
    whence our Misfortune proceeded.</p>

  <p>As soon as we had dropt Anchor, a <i>Piragua</i>, or great Sort of
    <i>Canoe</i>, came out from the Place, with Twenty Men, to know who
    we were, and hail’d us. Being inform’d that we were <i>French</i>,
    they acquainted us, that Monsieur <i>de Cussy</i> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>was at <i>Port de
    Paix</i> with the Marquis <i>de St. Laurent</i>, Lieutenant General of
    the <i>American</i> Islands, and Monsieur <i>Begon</i> the Intendant,
    which very much troubled Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, as having Affairs
    of the utmost Consequence to concert with them; but there was no
    remedy, and he was oblig’d to bear it with Patience.</p>

  <p>The next Day, being the 28th, we sang <i lang="la">Te Deum</i>, in Thanksgiving
    for our prosperous Passage. Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> being somewhat
    recover’d of his Indisposition, went Ashore with several of the
    Gentlemen of his Retinue, to buy some Refreshments for the Sick, and
    to find Means to send Notice of his Arrival, to Messieurs <i>de St.
    Laurent</i>, <i>de Cussy</i>, and <i>Begon</i>, and signify to them,
    how much he was concern’d that we had not put into <i>Port de Paix</i>.
    He writ particularly to Monsieur <i>de Cussy</i>, to desire he would
    come to him, if possible, that he might be assisting to him, and take
    the necessary Measures for rendering his Enterprize successful, that it
    might prove to the King’s Honour and Service.</p>

  <p>In the mean Time, the Sick suffering very much Aboard the Ships,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> by
    Reason of the Heat, and their being too close together, the Soldiers
    were put Ashore, on a little Island, near <i>Petit Gouaves</i>, which
    is the usual Burial-Place of the People of the pretended Reformed
    Religion,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> where they had fresh Provisions, and Bread baked on
    Purpose, distributed to them. As for the Sick, I was order’d by
    Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, to provide a House for them, whither
    they were carry’d, with the Surgeons, and supply’d with all that was
    requisite for them.</p>

  <p>Some Days after, Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> fell dangerously ill,
    most of his Family were also sick. A violent Fever, attended with
    Lightheadedness, brought him almost to Extremity. The Posture of his
    Affairs, Want of Money, and the Weight of a mighty Enterprize, without
    knowing whom to trust with the Execution of it, made him still more
    sick <span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>in Mind, than he was in his Body, and yet his Patience and
    Resolution surmounted all those Difficulties. He pitch’d upon Monsieur
    <i>le Gros</i> and me to act for him, caus’d some Commodities he had
    Aboard the Ships to be sold, to raise Money; and through our Care, and
    the excellent Constitution of his Body, he recover’d Health.</p>

  <p>Whilst he was in that Condition, two of our Ships, which had been
    separated from us on the 18th of <i>September</i>, by the stormy
    Winds, arriv’d at <i>Petit Gouave</i> on the 2d of <i>October</i>.<span class="sidenote ul">Oct. 1684.</span>
    The Joy conceiv’d on Account of their Arrival, was much allay’d by the
    News they brought of the Loss of the Ketch,<span class="sidenote">Ketch taken by the Spaniards.</span> taken by two <i>Spanish
    Piraguas</i>; and that Loss was the more grievous, because that Vessel
    was laden with Provisions, Ammunition, Utensils and proper Tools for
    the settling of our new Colonies; a Misfortune which would not have
    happen’d, had Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i> put into <i>Port de Paix</i>,
    and Messieurs <i>de St. Laurent</i>, <i>de Cussy</i>, and <i>Begon</i>
    who arrived at the same Time, to see Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> did not
    spare to signify as much to him, and to complain of that Miscarriage.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Nov. 1684</span>Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> being recover’d had several Conferences
    with these Gentlemen, relating to his Voyage. A Consult of Pilots
    was called to resolve where he should touch before we came upon the
    Coast of <i>America</i>, and it was resolved to steer directly for the
    Western Point of the Island of <i>Cuba</i>, or for <i>Cape</i> St.
    <i>Antony</i>, distant about 300 Leagues from <i>Hispaniola</i>, there
    to expect the proper Season, and a fair Wind to enter the Gulph or Bay,
    which is but Two hundred Leagues over.</p>

  <p>The next Care was to lay in Store of other Provisions, in the Room of
    those which were lost, and Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> was the more
    pressing for us to imbark, because most of his Men deserted, or were
    debauch’d by the Inhabitants of the Place; and the Vessel call’d <cite>l’
    Aimable</cite>, being the worst Sailer of our little Squadron, it was
    resolv’d that should carry the Light, and the others to follow it.
    Monsieur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> <i>de la Sale</i>, Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> his Brother, the
    Fathers <i>Zenobius</i><a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and <i>Anastasius</i>, both Recolets,
    Monsieur <i>Chedeville</i> and I imbark’d on the said <cite>Aimable</cite>
    and all sail’d the 25th of <i>November</i>.</p>

  <p>We met with some Calms, and some violent Winds, which nevertheless
    carry’d us in Sight of the Island of <i>Cuba</i>, on the 30th of the
    same Month, and it then bore from us <i>N. W.</i> There we alter’d our
    Course and steer’d <i>W.</i> and by <i>N.</i> The 31st, the Weather
    being somewhat close, we lost Sight of that Island, then stood <i>W.
    N. W.</i> and the Sky clearing up, made an Observation at Noon, and
    found we were in 19 Degrees, 45 Minutes of North Latitude: by which we
    judg’d that the Currents had carry’d us off to Sea from the Island of
    <i>Cuba</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Dec. 1684</span>On the first of <i>December</i>
    we discovered the Island <i>Cayman</i>.<span class="sidenote"><em>Cayman</em> Island.</span>
    The 2d we steer’d <i>N. W.</i> and by <i>W.</i> in order to come up
    with the Island of <i>Cuba</i> in the Northern Latitude of 20 Degrees
    32 Minutes. The 3d we discovered the little Island of <i>Pines</i>,<span class="sidenote">Island of <em>Pines</em>.</span>
    lying close to <i>Cuba</i>. The 4th, we weather’d a Point of that
    Island, and the Wind growing scant, were forc’d to ply upon a Bowling,
    and make several Trips till the 5th at Night, when we anchor’d in a
    Creek, in 15 Fathom Water, and continued there till the 8th.</p>

  <p>During that short Stay, Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> went Ashore with
    several Gentlemen of his Retinue on the Island of <i>Pines</i>, shot
    an Alligator dead, and returning Aboard, perceiv’d he had lost two of
    his Voluntiers, who had wander’d into the Woods, and perhaps lost their
    Way. We fired several Musquet Shots to call them, which they did not
    hear, and I was order’d to expect them ashore, with 30 Musquetiers to
    attend me. They return’d the next Morning with much Trouble.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Alligator eaten.</span>In the mean Time, our Soldiers, who had good Stomachs, boil’d and eat
    the Alligator, Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had kill’d. The flesh of
    it was white and had a Taste of Musk, for <span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>which Reason I could not
    eat it. One of our Hunters kill’d a wild Swine,<span class="sidenote">Wild Swine.</span> which the Inhabitants
    of those Islands call <i>Maron</i>. There are of them in the Island
    of <i>Santo Domingo</i>, or <i>Hispaniola</i>, they are of the Breed
    of those the <i>Spaniards</i> left in the Islands when they first
    discover’d them, and run wild in the Woods. I sent it to Monsieur <i>de
    la Sale</i>, who presented the one Half to Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i>.</p>

  <p>That Island is all over very thick wooded,<span class="sidenote">Island of <em>Pines</em>.</span> the Trees being of several
    Sorts, and some of them bear a Fruit resembling the Acorn, but
    harder. There are Abundance of Parrots, larger than those at <i>Petit
    Gouave</i>, a great Number of Turtle Doves and other Birds, and a Sort
    of Creatures resembling a Rat, but as big as a Cat, their Hair reddish.
    Our Men kill’d many of them and fed heartily on them, as they did on a
    good Quantity of Fish, wherewith that Coast abounds.</p>

  <p>We imbark’d again, as soon as the two Men who had stray’d were
    return’d, and on the 8th; being the Feast of the <i>Conception</i> of
    the Blessed Virgin, sail’d in the Morning, after having heard Mass,
    and the Wind shifting were forc’d to steer several Courses. The 9th we
    discover’d Cape <i>Corrientes</i>, of the Island of <i>Cuba</i>; where
    we were first becalm’d; and then follow’d a stormy Wind, which carried
    us away five Leagues to the Eastward. The 10th we spent the Night,
    making several Trips. The 11th, the Wind coming about, we weather’d
    Cape <i>Corrientes</i>,<span class="sidenote">The Capes <em>Corrientes</em> and St. <em>Antony</em>.</span> to make that of St. <i>Antony</i>; and at
    length, after plying a considerable Time, and sounding, we came to an
    Anchor the 12th, upon good Ground, in fifteen Fathom Water, in the
    Creek form’d by that Cape, which is in 22 Degrees of North Latitude and
    288 Degrees 35 Minutes of Longitude.</p>

  <p>We stay’d there only till next Day, being the 13th,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> when the Wind
    seem’d to be favourable to enter upon the Bay of <i>Mexico</i>. We made
    ready and sail’d, steering <i>N. W.</i> and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>by <i>N.</i> and <i>N. N.
    W.</i> to weather the said Cape and prosecute our Voyage: But by that
    Time we were five Leagues from the Place of our Departure, we perceiv’d
    the Wind shifted upon us, and not knowing which Way the Currents sate,
    we stood <i>E.</i> and by <i>N.</i> and held that Course till the
    14th, when Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i>, who was aboard the <cite>Joly</cite>,
    join’d us again, and having confer’d with Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>
    about the Wind’s being contrary, proposed to him to return to Cape St.
    <i>Antony</i>, to which Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> consented, to avoid
    giving him any Cause to complain, tho’ there was no great Occasion for
    so doing, and accordingly we went and anchor’d in the Place from whence
    we came.</p>

  <p>The next Day, being the 15th, Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> sent some
    Men ashore, to try whether we could fill some Casks with Water. They
    brought Word, they had found some in the Wood, which was not much
    amiss, but that there was no Conveniency for rowling of the Casks; for
    which Reason Rundlets were sent, and as much Water brought in them, as
    fill’d six or seven of our Water Casks.</p>

  <p>The same Men reported, that they had found a glass Bottle, and in
    it a little Wine, or some other Liquor, almost dead. This was all
    the Provision we found in that Place, by which it appears, how much
    Monsieur <i>Tonti</i> was misinform’d,<span class="sidenote">Mistake in Monsieur <em>Tonti’s</em> Account of the
    Voyage.</span> since in his Book, <i>Pag.</i>
    242, he says, we found in that Island several Tun of <i>Spanish</i>
    Wine, good Brandy and <i>Indian</i> Wheat, which the <i>Spaniards</i>
    had left or abandon’d; and it is a meer Invention without any Thing of Truth.</p>

  <p>The 16th, the Weather being still Calm, the Men went ashore again for
    five or six more Casks of Water. I was to have gone with them, had not
    an Indisposition, which I first felt in the Island of <i>Pines</i>, and
    afterwards turn’d to a tertian Ague, prevented me. Therefore I can give
    no Account of that Island, any further than what I could see from the
    Ships, which was Abundance of that Sort of Palm-Trees, in French call’d
    <i>Lataniers</i>, fit for nothing but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span> making of Brooms, or scarce any
    other Use. That day we saw some Smoaks, far within the Island, and
    guess’d they might be a Signal of the Number of our Ships, or else made
    by some of the Country Hunters, who had lost their Way.</p>

  <p>The next Night preceding the 17th, the Wind freshning from the <i>N.
    W.</i> and starting up all on a sudden, drove the Vessel call’d <cite>la
    Belle</cite> upon her Anchor, so that she came foul of the Boltsprit
    of the <cite>Aimable</cite>, carrying away the Spritsail-Yard and the
    Spritsail-Top-Sail-Yard, and had not they immediately veer’d out the
    Cable of the <cite>Aimable</cite>, the Vessel <cite>la Belle</cite> would have
    been in danger of perishing, but escap’d with the Loss of her Mizen,
    which came by the Board, and of about a hundred Fathoms of Cable and an Anchor.</p>

  <p>The 18th, the Wind being fresh, we made ready, and sail’d about Ten
    in the Morning, standing <i>North</i> and <i>N.</i> and by <i>W.</i>
    and held our Course till Noon; the Point of Cape St. <i>Anthony</i>
    bearing <i>East</i> and <i>West</i> with us, and so continu’d steering
    <i>North-West</i>, till the 19th at Noon, when we found our selves in
    the Latitude of 22 Degrees 58 minutes <i>North</i>, and in 287 Degrees
    54 Minutes Longitude.</p>

  <p>Finding the Wind shifting from one Side to another, we directed our
    Course several Ways, but that which prov’d advantageous to us, was the
    fair Weather, and that was a great Help, so that scarce a Day pass’d
    without taking an Observation.</p>

  <p>The 20th, we found the Variation of the Needle was 5 Degrees
    <i>West</i>, and we were in 26 Degrees 40 Minutes of North Latitude and
    285 Degrees 16 Minutes Longitude. The 23th it grew very cloudy,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
    which threaten’d stormy Weather, and we prepar’d to receive it, but
    came off only with the Apprehension, the Clouds dispersing several
    Ways, and we continu’d till the 27th in and about 28 Degrees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span> 14
    Minutes, and both by the Latitude and Estimation it was judg’d, that we
    were not far from Land.</p>

  <p>The Bark call’d <cite>la Belle</cite> was sent out to discover and keep
    before, sounding all the Way; and half an Hour before Sun-set, we
    saw the Vessel <cite>la Belle</cite> put out her Colours and lie by for
    us. Being come up with her, the Master told us, he had found an Owzy
    Bottom at thirty two Fathom Water. At eight of the Clock we sounded
    also, and found forty Fathom, and at ten, but twenty five. About
    Midnight, <cite>la Belle</cite> sounding again, found only seventeen, which
    being a Demonstration of the Nearness of the Land, we lay by for the
    <cite>Joly</cite>, to know what Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i> design’d, who
    being come up, lay by with us.</p>

  <p>The 27th, Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i> sent the <i>Chevalier d’Aire</i>,
    his Lieutenant, and two Pilots to Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, to
    conclude upon the Course we were to steer, and it was agreed we should
    stand West North West till we came into six Fathom Water; that then
    we should run West, and when we had discover’d the Land, Boats should
    be sent to view the Country. Matters being thus agreed on, we sail’d
    again, sounding all the Way for the more Security, and about ten, were
    in ten or eleven Fathom Water, the Bottom fine greyish Sand and owzy.
    At Noon, were in 26 Degrees<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> 37 Minutes of North Latitude.</p>

  <p>The 28th, being in eight or nine Fathom Water, we perceiv’d the Bark
    <i>la Belle</i>, which kept a Head of us, put out her Colours, which
    was the Signal of her having discover’d Something. A Sailor was sent
    up to the Main-Top, who descry’d the Land, to the N. E. not above
    six Leagues Distance from us, which being told to Monsieur <i>de
    Beaujeu</i>, he thought fit to come to an Anchor.</p>

  <p>There being no Man among us who had any Knowledge of that Bay, where
    we had been told the Currents were strong, and sate swiftly to the
    <i>Eastward</i>, it made us suspect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span> that we were fallen off, and that
    the Land we saw must be the Bay of <i>Apalache</i>, which oblig’d us on
    the 29th to steer <i>W. N. W.</i> still keeping along the Land, and it
    was agreed that the <cite>Joly</cite> should follow us in six Fathom Water.</p>

  <p>The 30th, the <i>Chevalier d’ Aire</i> and the second Pilot of the
    <cite>Joly</cite> came aboard us to confer and adjust by our Recknings what
    Place we might be in, and they all agreed, according to Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale’s</i> Opinion, that the Currents<span class="sidenote">Currents.</span> had set us to the
    <i>Eastward</i>, for which Reason we held on our Course, as we had
    done the Day before to the <i>N. W.</i> keeping along the Shore till
    the first of <i>January 1685</i>,<span class="sidenote ul">Jan. 1685</span> when we perceiv’d that the Currents
    forc’d us towards the Land, which oblig’d us to come to an Anchor in
    six Fathom Water.</p>

  <p>We had not been there long, before the Bark <cite>la Belle</cite> made
    a Signal that she had discover’d Land, which we descry’d at about
    4 Leagues Distance from us. Notice was given to Monsieur <i>de
    Beaujeu</i>, who drew near to us, and it was resolv’d to send some
    Person to discover and take an Account of the Land that appear’d to us.</p>

  <p>Accordingly a Boat was man’d, and into it went Monsieur <i>de la
    Sale</i>, the <i>Chevalier d’ Aire</i> and several others; another
    Boat was also put out, aboard which I went with Ten or Twelve of our
    Gentlemen, to join Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> and the Bark <cite>la
    Belle</cite> was order’d to follow always keeping along the Shore; to the
    End that if the Wind shou’d rise, we might get aboard her, to lose no Time.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">First Landing.</span>Some of those who were in Monsieur <i>de la Sale’s</i> Boat, and
    the foremost,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> went ashore and saw a spacious plain Country of
    much Pasture Ground; but had not the Leisure to make any particular
    Discovery, because the Wind freshning, they were oblig’d to return to
    their Boat, to come aboard again; which was the Reason why we did not
    go quite up to the Shore, but return’d with them to our Ship. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>All
    that could be taken Notice of was a great Quantity of Wood along the
    Coast. We took an Observation and found 29 Degrees 10 Minutes of North
    Latitude.</p>

  <p>The Second, there arose a Fog, which made us lose Sight of the
    <cite>Joly</cite>. The next Day, the Weather clearing up, we fir’d some
    Cannon-shot and the <cite>Joly</cite> answer’d, and towards the Evening we
    perceiv’d her to the Windward of us. We held on our Course, making
    several Trips till the Fourth in the Evening, when being in Sight and
    within two Leagues of the Land, we came to an Anchor to expect the
    <cite>Joly</cite>, for which we were in Pain.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Monsieur <em>Joutel</em> believes here was one of the
    Mouths of the <em>Missisipi</em>. See the Pref. and what follows.</span>The Fifth, we set Sail and held on our Course <i>W. S. W.</i> keeping
    along the Shore till about Six in the Evening, when we stood away to
    the <i>Southward</i> and anchor’d at Night in six Fathom Water. The
    Sixth, we would have made ready to sail, but the Pilot perceiving,
    that the Sea broke astern of us, and that there were some Shoals, it
    was thought proper to continue at Anchor, till the Wind chang’d, and
    we accordingly staid there the Sixth and all the Seventh. The Eighth
    the Wind veering about, we stood out a little to Sea, to avoid those
    Shoals, which are very dangerous, and anchor’d again a League from
    thence. Upon Advice, that the Bark <cite>la Belle</cite> had discover’d a
    small Island, which appear’d between the two Points of a Bay, Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i> sent a Man up to the round Top, from whence both the
    one and the other were plainly to be seen, and according to the Sea
    Charts we had with us, that was suppos’d to be the Bay of the <i>Holy
    Ghost</i>.</p>

  <p>The Ninth, Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, sent to view those Shoals. Those
    who went reported there was a sort of Bank, which runs along the Coast;
    that they had been in one Fathom Water and discover’d the little Island
    beforemention’d, and as for the Sand Bank there is no such thing mark’d
    down in the Charts. Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> having examin’d the
    Recknings, was confirm’d in his Opinion, that we were in the Bay of
    <i>Apalache</i>, and caus’d us to continue the same Course.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

  <p>The Tenth, he took an Observation and found 29 Degrees 23 Minutes
    North Latitude. The eleventh, we were becalm’d, and Monsieur <i>de
    la Sale</i> resolv’d to go ashore, to endeavour to discover what he
    was looking for; but as we were making ready, the Pilot began to
    mutter because five or six of us were going with Monsieur <i>de la
    Sale</i>, who too lightly alter’d his Design, to avoid giving Offence
    to brutish People. In that Particular he committed an irretrieveable
    Error; for it is the Opinion of Judicious Men, who, as well as I, saw
    the rest of that Voyage, that the Mouth of one of the Branches of the
    <i>Missisipi</i> River, and the same whose Latitude Monsieur <i>de la
    Sale</i> had taken, when he travell’d to it from <i>Canada</i>, was not
    far from that Place, and that we must of Necessity be near the Bay of
    the <i>Holy Ghost</i>.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

  <p>It was Monsieur <i>de la Sale’s</i> Design<span class="sidenote">Monsieur <em>de la Sale’s</em> Mistake.</span> to find that Bay, and having
    found it, he had resolv’d to have set ashore about thirty Men, who
    were to have follow’d the Coast on the Right and Left, which would
    infallibly have discover’d to him that fatal River, and have prevented
    many Misfortunes; but Heaven refus’d him that Success, and even made
    him regardless of an Affair of such Consequence, since he was satisfy’d
    with sending thither the Pilot, with one of the Masters of the Bark
    <cite>la Belle</cite>, who return’d without having seen any Thing, because
    a fog happen’d to rise; only the Master of the Bark said he believ’d
    there was a River opposite to those Shoals, which was very likely,
    and yet Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> took no Notice of it, nor made any
    Account of that Report.</p>

  <p>The Twelfth, the Wind being come about we weigh’d and directed our
    Course <i>S. W.</i> to get further from the Land. By an Observation
    found 25<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Degrees 50 Minutes <span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>North Latitude, and the Wind shifting,
    and the Currents, which set from the Seaward driving us ashore, it was
    found convenient to anchor in four or five Fathom Water, where we spent
    all the Night.</p>

  <p>The Thirteenth, we perceiv’d our Water began to fall short, and
    therefore it was requisite to go ashore to fill some Casks. Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i> propos’d it to me to go and see it perform’d, which
    I accepted of, with six of our Gentlemen who offer’d their Service. We
    went into the Boat, with our Arms, the Boat belonging to the Bark <cite>la
    Belle</cite> follow’d ours, with five or six Men, and we all made directly
    for the Land.</p>

  <p>We were very near the Shoar, when we discover’d a number of naked Men
    marching along the Banks, whom we suppos’d to be native Savages. We
    drew within two Musket Shots of the Land, and the Shore being flat,
    the Wind setting from the Offing, and the Sea running high, dropt our
    Anchors, for Fear of staving our Boats.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Savages came to the Boat.</span>When the Savages perceiv’d we had stopp’d, they made Signs to us with
    Skins, to go to them, shew’d us their Bows, which they laid down upon
    the Ground, and drew near to the Edge of the Shore; but because we
    could not get Ashore, and still they continued their Signals, I put my
    Handkerchief on the End of my Firelock, after the Manner of a Flag, and
    made Signs to them to come to us. They were some Time considering of
    it, and at last some of them ran into the Water up to their Shoulders,
    till perceiving that the Waves overwhelm’d them, they went out again,
    fetch’d a large Piece of Timber, which they threw into the Sea, plac’d
    themselves along both Sides of it, holding fast to it with one Arm, and
    swimming with the other; and in that Manner they drew near to our Boat.</p>

  <p>Being in Hopes that Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i>, might get some
    Information from those Savages, we made no Difficulty of taking them
    into our Boat, one after another, on each Side, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>to the Number of five,
    and then made Signs to the rest to go to the other Boat, which they
    did, and we carry’d them on Board.<span class="sidenote">Carryed Aboard.</span></p>

  <p>Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> was very well pleas’d to see them, imagining
    they might give him some Account of the River he sought after; but to
    no Purpose, for he spoke to them in several of the Languages of the
    Savages, which he knew, and made many Signs to them, but still they
    understood not what he meant, or if they did comprehend any thing, they
    made Signs, that they knew nothing of what he ask’d; so that having
    made them smoak and eat, we shewed them our Arms and the Ship, and when
    they saw at one End of it some Sheep, Swine, Hens and Turkeys, and the
    Hide of a Cow we had kill’d, they made Signs that they had of all those
    Sorts of Creatures among them.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Return Ashore with Gifts.</span>We gave them some Knives and Strings of Beads, after which, they were
    dismiss’d, and the Waves hindring us from coming too near the Shore,
    they were oblig’d to leap into the Water, after we had made fast about
    their Necks, or to the Tuft of Hair they have on the Top of the Head,
    the Knives and other small Presents Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had
    given them.</p>

  <p>They went and join’d the others who expected them, and were making
    Signs to us to go to them; but not being able to make the Shore, we
    stood off again and return’d to our Ship. It is to be observed, that
    when we were carrying them back, they made some Signs to us, by which
    we conceiv’d they would signify to us that there was a great River that
    Way we were pass’d, and that it occasion’d the Shoals we had seen.</p>

  <p>The Wind changing, the same Day, we weigh’d Anchor and stood to the
    Southward, to get into the Offing, till the 14th in the Morning, when
    we were becalm’d. At Noon, we were in 28 Degrees 51 Minutes of North
    Latitude. The Wind freshned, and in the Evening we held on our Course,
    but only for a short Time, because the Wind setting us towards the
    Shore, we were obliged to anchor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span> again, whereupon Monsieur <i>de la
    Sale</i> again resolved to send Ashore, and the same Persons imbark’d
    in the same Boats to that effect.</p>

  <p>We met with the same Obstacles, that had hinder’d us the Day before,
    that is, the High-Sea, which would not permit us to come near the
    Shore, and were obliged to drop Anchor in fourteen Foot Water.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The
    Sight of Abundance of Goats and Bullocks,<span class="sidenote">Goats and Bullocks.</span> differing in Shape, from
    ours, and running along the Coast, heighten’d our Earnestness to be
    Ashore. We therefore sounded to see whether we might get to Land by
    Stripping, and found we were on a Flat, which had four Foot Water, but
    that beyond it there was a deep Channel. Whilst we were consulting what
    to do, a Storm arose, which oblig’d Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> to fire
    a Gun for us to return Aboard, which we did against our Inclination.</p>

  <p>Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> was pleas’d with the Report we made him,
    and by it, several were encouraged to go Ashore to hunt, that we might
    have some fresh Meat. We spent all that Night, till the next Morning,
    in Hopes of returning soon to that Place; but the Wind changing, forc’d
    us to weigh and sail till the Evening, when we drop’d Anchor in six
    Fathom Water. The Land which we never departed from very far, appear’d
    to us very pleasant, and having lain there till the 16th, that Morning
    we sail’d <i>W. S. W.</i> We weather’d a Point, keeping a large Offing,
    because of the Sea’s beating upon it, and stood to the Southward.
    At Noon, we were in 28 Degrees 20 Minutes of North Latitude, and
    consequently found the Latitude declin’d, by which we were sensible,
    that the Coast tendered to the Southward. At Night we anchor’d in six
    Fathom Water.</p>

  <p>The 17th, the Wind continuing the same, we held on our Course <i>S.
    W.</i> and having about Ten discover’d a Sort of River, Monsieur <i>de
    la Sale</i> caus’d Ten of us to go into a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>Boat, to take a View of that
    Coast, and see whether there was not some Place to land. He order’d me,
    in Case we found any convenient Place, to give him Notice either by
    Fire or Smoke.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Second landing.</span>We set out, and found the Shoals obstructed our Descent. One of our Men
    went naked into the Water to sound that Sand Bank, which lay between us
    and the Land; and having shewn us a Place where we might Pass, we, with
    much Difficulty, forc’d our Boat into the Channel, and six or seven
    of us landed, after ordering the Boat to go up into that which had
    appeared to us to be a River, to see whether any fresh Water could be
    found.</p>

  <p>As soon as we were landed, I made a Smoke to give Notice to Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i>, and then we advanc’d both Ways, without straggling
    too far, that we might be ready to receive Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i>,
    who was to come, as he did, soon after, but finding the Surges run
    high, he return’d, and our Boat finding no fresh Water, came back and
    anchor’d to wait for us.</p>

  <p>We walked about every Way, and found a dry Soil, tho’ it seem’d to be
    overflow’d at some Times; great Lakes of salt Water, little Grass, the
    Track of Goats, on the Sand, and saw Herds of them, but could not come
    near them, however we kill’d some Ducks and Bustards. In the Evening,
    as we were returning, we miss’d an English Seaman, fir’d several Shots
    to give him Notice, searched all about, waited till after Sunset, and
    at last hearing no Tidings of him, we went into the Boat to return
    Aboard.</p>

  <p>I gave Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> an Account of what we had seen, which
    would have pleas’d him, had the River we discover’d, afforded fresh
    Water: He was also uneasy for the lost Man; but about Midnight we saw a
    Fire Ashore, in the Place we came from, which we suppos’d to be made by
    our Man, and the Boat went for him as soon as it was day on the 18th.</p>

  <p>After that, we made several Trips, still steering towards the <i>S.
    W.</i> and then ensued a Calm, which oblig’d us to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> come to an Anchor.
    Want of Water made us think of returning towards the River, where we
    had been the Day before. Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i> resolved to set a
    considerable Number of Men Ashore, with sufficient Ammunition, and to
    go with them himself, to discover and take Cognizance of that Country,
    and order’d me to follow him. Accordingly we sail’d back, and came to
    an Anchor in the same Place.</p>

  <p>All things necessary for that end being order’d on the 19th, Part of
    the Men were put into a Boat;<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> but a very thick Fog rising, and
    taking away the Sight of Land, the Compass was made use of, and the
    fog dispersing as we drew near the Land, we perceiv’d a Ship making
    directly towards us, and that it was the <cite>Joly</cite>, where Monsr.
    <i>de Beaujeu</i> commanded, which rejoic’d us, but our Satisfaction
    was not lasting, and it will appear by the Sequel, that it were to have
    been wished, that Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i> had not joyn’d us again,
    but that he had rather gone away for <i>France</i>, without ever seeing of us.</p>

  <p>His Arrival disconcerted the Execution of our Enterprize. Monsr.
    <i>de la Sale</i>, who was already on his Way, and those who were
    gone before him, return’d Aboard, and some Hours after, Monsr. <i>de
    Beaujeu</i> sent his Lieutenant, Monsr. <i>de Aire</i>, attended by
    several Persons, as well Clergymen as others, among whom was the Sieur
    <i>Gabaret</i>, second Pilot of the <cite>Joly</cite>.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Commanders at Variance.</span>Monsieur <i>d’ Aire</i> complain’d grievously to Monsieur <i>de la
    Sale</i>, in the Name of Monsr. <i>de Beaujeu</i>, for that said he, we
    had left him designedly; which was not true, for as I have said, the
    <cite>Joly</cite> lay at Anchor A-head of us, when we were separated from
    her; we fired a Gun to give her Notice of our Departure, as had been
    concerted, and Monsr. <i>de Beaujeu</i> answer’d it; besides that, if
    we had intended to separate from him, we should not have always held
    our Course in Sight of Land, as we had done, and that had <span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>Monsieur
    <i>de Beaujeu</i> held the same Course, as had been agreed, he had not
    been separated from us.</p>

  <p>There were afterwards several Disputes between the Captains and the
    Pilots, as well Aboard Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, as Aboard Monsieur
    <i>de Beaujeu</i>, when those Gentlemen return’d, about settling
    exactly the Place we were in, and the Course we were to steer; some
    positively affirming we were farther than we imagin’d, and that the
    Currents had carry’d us away; and others, that we were near the
    <i>Magdalen</i> River.</p>

  <p>The former of those Notions prevail’d, whence, upon Reflection,
    Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> concluded, that he must be past his River,<span class="sidenote">They pass the Mouth of the <em>Missisipi</em>.</span>
    which was but too true; for that River emptying it self in the Sea by
    two Channels, it follow’d that one of the Mouths fell about the Shoals
    we had observ’d the sixth of the Month; and the rather because those
    Shoals were very near the Latitude that Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had
    observ’d, when he came by the way of <i>Canada</i> to discover the
    Mouth of that River, as he told me several Times.</p>

  <p>This Consideration prevail’d with Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> to propose
    his Design of returning towards those Shoals. He gave his Reasons for
    so doing and exposed his Doubts; but his ill Fortune made him not be
    regarded. Our Passage had taken up more Time than had been expected,
    by Reason of the Calms; there was a considerable Number of Men aboard
    the <cite>Joly</cite>, and Provisions grew short, insomuch that they said
    it would not hold out to return, if our Departure were delay’d. For
    this Reason Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i> demanded Provisions of Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i>; but he asking enough for a long Time, Monsieur <i>de
    la Sale</i> answer’d, he could only give him enough for a Fortnight,
    which was more Time than was requisite to reach the Place he intended
    to return to; and that besides he could not give him more Provisions,
    without rummaging all the Stores to the Bottom of the Hold, which would
    endanger his being cast away. Thus nothing was concluded, and Monsieur
    <i>de Beaujeu</i> return’d to his own Ship.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Third Landing.</span>In the mean Time, Want of Water began to pinch us, and Monsieur <i>de
    la Sale</i> resolv’d to send to look for some about the next River.
    Accordingly he order’d the two Boats that had been made ready the Day
    before, to go off. He was aboard one of them himself, and directed me
    to follow him. Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i> also commanded his Boat to
    go for Wood. By the Way we met the said Sieur <i>de Beaujeu</i> in his
    Yaul, returning from Land, with the Sieur <i>Minet</i>, an Ingenier,
    who told us, they had been in a Sort of salt Pool, two or three Leagues
    from the Place where the Ships were at Anchor, we held on our Way and
    landed.</p>

  <p>One of our Boats, which was gone ahead of us, had been a League and a
    half up the River, without finding any fresh Water in its Channel; but
    some Men wandering about to the right and left, had met with divers
    Rivulets<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> of very good Water, wherewith many Casks were fill’d.</p>

  <p>We lay ashore, and our Hunters having that Day kill’d good Store of
    Ducks, Bustards and Teal, and the next Day two Goats, Monsieur <i>de
    la Sale</i> sent Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i> Part. We feasted upon the
    rest, and that good Sport put several Gentlemen that were then aboard
    Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i>, among whom were Monsieur <i>du Hamel</i>,
    the Ensign and the King’s Clerk, upon coming ashore to partake of the
    Diversion; but they took much Pains and were not successful in their
    Sport.</p>

  <p>In the mean Time many Casks were fill’d with Water, as well for our
    Ship as for Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu’s</i>. Some Days after Monsieur
    <i>d’ Aire</i> the Lieutenant, came ashore to confer with Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i>, and to know how he would manage about the
    Provisions; but both of them persisting in their first Proposals and
    Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> perceiving that Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i>
    would not be satisfied with Provisions for 15 Days, which he thought
    sufficient to go to the Place where he expected to find one of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>Branches of the <i>Missisipi</i>, which he with good Reason believ’d
    to be about the Shoals, I have before spoken of, nothing was concluded
    as to that Affair. Monsieur <i>d’ Aire</i> return’d to his Captain, and
    Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> resolv’d to land his Men; which could not be
    done for some Days, because of the foul Weather; but in the mean Time
    we kill’d much Game.</p>

  <p>During this little Interval, Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> being impatient
    to get some Intelligence of what he sought after, resolv’d to go
    himself upon Discovery, and to seek out some more useful and commodious
    River than that where they were. To this Purpose he took five or six of
    us along with him. We set out one Morning in so thick a Fog, that the
    hindmost could not perceive the Track of the foremost, so that we lost
    Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> for some Time.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Account of the Country.</span>We travel’d till about three in the Afternoon, finding the Country
    for the most Part Sandy, little Grass, no fresh Water, unless in some
    Sloughs,<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> the Track of abundance of wild Goats, Lakes full of Ducks,
    Teals, Water-Hens, and having taken much Pains return’d without Success.</p>

  <p>The next Morning, Monsieur <i>de la Sale’s</i> <i>Indian</i>, going
    about to find wild Goats, came to a Lake, which had a little Ice upon
    it, the Weather being cold, and Abundance of Fish dying about the
    Edges of it. He came to inform us, we went to make our Provision of
    them, there were some of a prodigious Magnitude, and among the rest
    extraordinary large Trouts, or else they were some Sort of Fish very
    like them. We caused some of each of a Sort to be boil’d in salt Water,
    and found them very good. Thus having Plenty of Fish and Flesh, we
    began to use ourselves to eat them both, without Bread.</p>

  <p>Whilst we liv’d thus easy enough, Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> expected
    with Impatience to know what Resolution Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i>
    would take; that he might either go to the Place, where he expected to
    find the <i>Missisipi</i>, or follow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span> some other Course; but at last,
    perceiving that his Affairs did not advance, he resolv’d to put his
    own Design in Execution, the Purport whereof was to land one hundred
    and twenty, or one hundred and thirty Men to go along the Coast and
    continue it, till they had found some other River, and that at the same
    Time the Bark <i>la Belle</i> should hold the same Course at Sea, still
    keeping along the Coast, to relieve those Ashore in Time of Need.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Feb. 1685</span>He gave me and Monsieur <i>Moranget</i>, his Nephew, the Command of
    that small Company, he furnish’d us with all Sorts of Provisions for
    eight, or ten Days, as also Arms, Tools and Utensils we might have
    Occasion for, of which every Man made his Bundle. He also gave us
    written Instructions of what we were to do, the Signals we were to
    make; and thus we set out on the Fourth of <i>February</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Men sent by Land to discover.</span>We took our Way along the Shore. Our first Day’s Journey was not long,
    we encamp’d on a little rising Ground, heard a Cannon shot, which made
    us uneasy, made the Signals that had been appointed, and the next Day,
    being the 5th, we held on our March, Monsieur <i>Moranget</i> bringing
    up the Rear, and I leading the Van.</p>

  <p>I will not spend Time in relating several personal Accidents,
    inconsiderable in themselves, or of no Consequence, the most
    considerable of them being the Want of fresh Water; but will proceed
    to say, that after three Days March we found a great River, where we
    halted and made the Signals agreed on, encamping on a commodious Spot
    of Ground till we could hear of the Boat, which was to follow us, or of
    our Ships.</p>

  <p>But our Provisions beginning to fall short, and none of our Ships
    appearing, being besides apprehensive of some unlucky Accident
    occasion’d by the Disagreement between Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> and
    Monsr. <i>de Beaujeu</i>, the Chief of our Company came together to
    know what Resolution we should take. It was agreed, that we should
    spare our Provisions to endeavour to go on to some Place where we
    might find Bullocks; but it was requisite to cross the River,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span> and we
    knew not how, because we were too many of us, and therefore it was
    decreed to set some Carpenters there were among-us at Work to build
    a little Boat,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> which took them up the eleventh and twelfth of
    <i>February</i>.</p>

  <p>The 13th, we were put out of our Pain by two Vessels we discover’d at
    Sea, which we knew to be the <cite>Joly</cite> and <cite>la Belle</cite>, to whom
    we made our Signals with Smoke. They came not in then, because it was
    late, but the next Day being the 14th in the Morning, the Boat, with
    the Sieur <i>Barbier</i> and the Pilot of the Bark <cite>la Belle</cite> come
    up, and both sounded the Mouth of the River.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">A fine River.</span>They found on the Bar, from ten to twelve Foot Water, and within it
    from five to six Fathom; the Breadth of the River being about half a
    Quarter of a League. They sounded near the Island, which lies between
    the two Points of the Bay, and found the same Depth. The Boat of the
    <cite>Joly</cite> came and sounded on the other Side of the Channel, and
    particularly along the Shoals, I know not to what Purpose. The same
    Day, Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, for whom we were much in Pain, came
    also, and as soon as he arrived, he caus’d the Boat to be laden with
    such Provisions as we stood in Need of, but the Wind being contrary, it
    could not come to us till the next Day, being the 15th.</p>

  <p>That same Day, Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i> came Ashoar to view the Place
    and examine the Entrance into the River, which he found to be very
    good. Having consider’d all Particulars, he resolv’d to send in the
    Bark <cite>la Belle</cite> and <cite>l’ Aimable</cite>, that they might be under
    Shelter, to which Purpose, he order’d to sound, and to know whether
    those two Vessels could both come in that same Day. Monsieur <i>de
    Beaujeu</i> caus’d also the Place to be sounded, and lay Ashoar on the
    other Side of the River, where he took Notice there were Vines which
    run up the Trees, like our <span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>Wall Vines, some Woods and the Carcasses of
    Bullocks, which he supposed to have died with Thirst.</p>

  <p>The 16th, the Pilots of the <cite>Joly</cite>, <cite>l’ Aimable</cite> and <cite>la
    Belle</cite>, went again to sound, they found the Entrance easy, and gave
    it under their Hands. The 17th, they fix’d Stakes to mark out the Way,
    that the Vessels might come safe in. All Things seem’d to promise a
    happy Event.</p>

  <p>The 18th, the Chevalier <i>d’ Aire</i> came ashore, to confer with
    Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, who being desirous to have the Fly-boat
    <cite>l’ Aimable</cite> come in that Day, order’d the most weighty Things
    in her to be unloaded, as the Cannon, the Iron and some other Things.
    It was my good Fortune that my Chest stood in the Way, and was also
    unloaded, but that Unlading could not be done till the next Day, being
    the 19th. That being perform’d, the Captain affirm’d it would go in at
    8 Foot Water.</p>

  <p>The 20th, Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> sent Orders to that Captain to
    draw near the Bar, and to come in at high Water, of which a Signal
    should be given him; he also order’d the Pilot of the Bark <cite>la
    Belle</cite> to go aboard the Flyboat, to be assisting when it came in.
    The Captain would not receive him aboard, saying, he could carry in his
    Ship without his Help. All these Precautions prov’d of no Use; Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i> could not avert his ill Fate. He having taken Notice
    of a large Tree on the Bank of the River, which he judg’d fit to make
    a Canoe, sent 7 or 8 Workmen to hew it down, two of whom return’d some
    Time after, in a great Fright, and told him, they had narrowly escap’d
    being taken by a Company of Savages,<span class="sidenote">A Company of Savages.</span> and that they believ’d the others
    had fallen into their Hands. Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> order’d us
    immediately to handle our Arms, and to march with Drums beating towards
    the Savages, who seeing us in that Posture, fac’d about and went off.</p>

  <p>Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> being desirous to join those Savages, to
    endeavour to get some Information from them, order’d Ten of us to lay
    down our Arms and draw near them, making Signs to them, at the same
    Time, to come to us.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

  <p>When they saw us in that Posture and unarm’d, most of them also laid
    down their Bows and Arrows<span class="sidenote">Their Friendly Behaviour.</span> and came to meet us, caressing us after
    their Manner, and stroking first their own Breasts and then ours, then
    their own Arms and afterwards ours. By these Signs they gave us to
    understand that they had a Friendship for us, which they express’d by
    laying their Hands on their Hearts, and we did the same on our Part.</p>

  <p>Six or seven of those Savages went along with us, and the rest kept
    three of our Men, in the Nature of Hostages. Those who went with
    us were made much of, but Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> could learn
    nothing of them, either by Signs or otherwise; all they could make us
    understand was, that there was good hunting of Bullocks in the Country.
    We observ’d, that their <em>Yea</em> consisted in a Cry, fetch’d from
    the Bottom of the Throat, not unlike the Call of a Hen to gather her
    Chickens. Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> gave them some Knives, Hatchets
    and other Trifles, with which they seem’d well pleased, and went away.</p>

  <p>Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> was glad to be rid of those People, because
    he was willing to be present when the Flyboat came in; but his ill Fate
    would not permit it. He thought fit to go himself along with those
    Savages, and we follow’d him, thinking to have found our Men in the
    same Place where we left them; but perceiv’d on the Contrary, that
    the Savages had carried them away to their Camp, which was a League
    and half from us, and Monsieur <i>de la Sablonniere</i>. Lieutenant
    of Foot, being one of those the Savages had taken with them. Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i> resolved to go himself to fetch him away, an unhappy
    Thought which cost him dear.</p>

  <p>As we were on our Way towards the Camp of the Savages, happening to
    look towards the Sea, we saw the Flyboat <cite>l’ Aimable</cite> under Sail,
    which the Savages who were with us admir’d, and Monsieur <i>de la
    Sale</i> observing it narrowly, told us, those People steer’d wrong,
    and were standing towards the Shoals, which made him very uneasy, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
    still we advanc’d. We arriv’d at the Camp of the Savages,<span class="sidenote">Their Camp.</span> which stood
    upon an Eminence, and consisted of about Fifty Cottages made of rush
    Mats, and others of dry’d Skins, and built with long Poles, bow’d round
    at the Top, like great Ovens, and most of the Savages sitting about, as
    if they were upon the Watch.</p>

  <p>We were still advancing into the Village, when he heard a Cannon Shot,
    the Noise whereof struck such a Dread among the Savages, that they
    all fell flat upon the Ground; but Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> and we
    were too sensible it was a Signal that our Ship was aground, which was
    confirm’d by seeing them furl their Sails; However we were gone too far
    to return; our Men must be had, and to that Purpose, we must proceed to
    the Hut of the Commander in Chief.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

  <p>As soon as we arrived there, Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i> was introduc’d;
    many of the <i>Indian</i> Women came in, they were very deform’d<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
    and all naked, excepting a Skin girt about them, which hung down to
    their Knees. They would have led us to their Cottages, but Monsr.
    <i>de la Sale</i> had order’d us not to part, and to observe whether
    the <i>Indians</i> did not draw together, so that we kept together,
    standing upon our Guard, and I was always with him.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Their Entertainment.</span>They brought us some Pieces of Beef, both fresh and dry’d in the Air
    and Smoke, and Pieces of Porpois, which they cut with a Sort of Knife,
    made of Stone, setting one Foot upon it, and holding with one Hand,
    whilst they cut with the other. We saw nothing of Iron among them.
    They had given our Men, that came with them, to eat, and Monsr. <i>de
    la Sale</i> being extraordinary uneasy, we soon took Leave of them to
    return. At our going out, we observ’d about forty Canoes, some of them
    like those Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i> had seen on the <i>Missisipi</i>,
    which made him conclude he was not far from it.</p>

  <p>We soon arrived at our Camp, and found the Misfortune, Monsr. <i>de la
    Sale</i> had apprehended, was but too <span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>certain. The Ship was stranded
    on the Shoals. The ill Management of the Captain, or of the Pilot,<span class="sidenote"><em>L’ Aimable</em> cast away.</span> who
    had not steer’d by the Stakes placed for that Purpose; the Cries of
    a Sailor posted on the Main-top, who cry’d amain, <em>Loof</em>, which
    was to steer towards the Passage marked out, whilst the wicked Captain
    cry’d, <em>Come no nearer</em>, which was to steer the contrary Course;
    the same Captain’s Carelesness in not dropping his Anchor, as soon as
    the Ship touch’d, which would have prevented her sticking aground; the
    Folly of lowering his Main-Sheet and hoisting out his Sprit-Sail, the
    better to fall into the Wind, and secure the Shipwreck; the Captain’s
    refusing to admit the Pilot of the Bark <cite>la Belle</cite>, whom Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i> had sent to assist him; the sounding upon the Shoals
    to no Purpose, and several other Circumstances reported by the Ship’s
    Crew and those who saw the Management, were infallible Tokens and
    Proofs, that the Mischief had been done designedly and adviseably,
    which was one of the blackest and most detestable Actions that Man
    could be guilty of.</p>

  <p>This Misfortune was so much the greater, because that Vessel contain’d
    almost all the Ammunition, Utensils, Tools and other Necessaries for
    Monsr. <i>de la Sale’s</i> Enterprize and Settlement. He had need of
    all his Resolution to bear up against it; but his Intrepidity did not
    forsake him, and he apply’d himself, without grieving, to Remedy what
    might be. All the Men were taken out of the Ship; he desir’d Monsieur
    <i>de Beaujeu</i> to lend him his long Boat, to help save as much as
    might be. We began with Powder and Meal. About thirty Hogsheads of
    Wine and Brandy were saved, and Fortune being incens’d against us, two
    Things contributed to the total Loss of all the rest:</p>

  <p>The first was, that our Boat, which hung at the Stern of the Ship run
    A-ground, was maliciously stav’d in the Night, so that we had none left
    but Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu’s</i>. The second, that the Wind blowing
    in from the Offing, made the Waves run high, which beating violently
    against the Ship, split her, and all the light Goods were carry’d out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
    at the opening, by the Water. This last Misfortune happen’d also in the
    Night. Thus every Thing fell out most unhappily, for had that befallen
    in the Day, Abundance of Things might have been saved.</p>

  <p>Whilst we were upon this melancholy Employment, about an hundred, or
    an hundred and twenty of the Natives came to our Camp, with their Bows
    and Arrows. Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> order’d us to handle our Arms,
    and stand upon our Guard. About twenty of those <i>Indians</i> mix’d
    themselves among us, to observe what we had saved of the Shipwreck,
    upon which, there were several Sentinels,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> to let none come near the
    Powder.</p>

  <p>The rest of the <i>Indians</i> stood in Parcels, or Pelotons. Monsr.
    <i>de la Sale</i>, who was acquainted with their Ways, order’d us
    to observe their Behaviour, and to take Nothing from them, which
    nevertheless did not hinder some of our Men from receiving some
    Pieces of Meat. Some Time after, when the <i>Indians</i> were about
    departing, they made Signs to us to go a Hunting with them; but besides
    that, there was sufficient Cause to suspect them, we had enough other
    Business to do. However we ask’d, whether they would barter for any of
    their Canoes, which they agreed to. The Sieur <i>Barbier</i> went along
    with them, purchas’d two for Hatchets and brought them.</p>

  <p>Some Days after, we perceiv’d a Fire in the Country, which spread it
    self and burnt the dry Weeds, still drawing towards us; whereupon,
    Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i> made all the Weeds and Herbs that were about
    us, be pull’d up, and particularly all about the Place where the Powder
    was. Being desirous to know the Occasion of that Fire, he took about
    twenty of us along with him, and we march’d that Way, and even beyond
    the Fire, without seeing any Body. We perceiv’d that it run towards the
    <i>W. S. W.</i> and judg’d it had begun about our first Camp, and at
    the Village next the Fire.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

  <p>Having spy’d a Cottage near the Bank of a Lake, we drew towards it,
    and found an old Woman in it, who fled as soon as she saw us; but
    having overtaken and given her to understand, that we would do her no
    Harm, she return’d to her Cottage, where we found some Pitchers of
    Water, of which we all drank. Some Time after we saw a Canoe coming,
    in which were two Women and a Boy, who being landed, and perceiving
    we had done the old Woman no Harm, came and imbraced us in a very
    particular Manner,<span class="sidenote">Odd Salutation.</span>
    blowing upon our Ears and making Signs to give us to
    understand, that their People were a hunting.</p>

  <p>A few Minutes after, seven or eight of the <i>Indians</i> appeared,
    who, it is likely, had hid themselves among the Weeds when they saw
    us coming. Being come up they saluted us, after the same Manner, as
    the Women had done, which made us laugh. We staid there some Time with
    them. Some of our Men barter’d Knives for Goats Skins, after which we
    return’d to our Camp; Being come thither, Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>
    made me go aboard the Bark <cite>la Belle</cite>, where he had imbark’d Part
    of the Powder, with positive Orders not to carry, or permit any Fire to
    be made there, having sufficient Cause to fear every thing, after what
    had hapned. For this Reason they carry’d me and all that were with me,
    our Meat every Day.</p>

  <p>During this time it was that <cite>l’ Aimable</cite> opening in the Night,
    the next Morning we saw all the light Things that were come out of it
    floating about, and Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> sent Men every Way, who
    gather’d up about 30 Casks of Wine and Brandy, and some of Flesh, Meal
    and Grain.</p>

  <p>When we had gather’d all, as well what had been taken out of the
    Ship-wreck’d Vessel as what could be pick’d up in the Sea, the next
    Thing was to regulate the Provisions we had left proportionably to
    the Number of Men we were; and there being no more Bisket, Meal was
    deliver’d out, and with it we made Hasty Pudding with Water, which
    was none of the best; some large Beans and <i>India</i> Corn, part of
    which had taken wet; and every thing was distributed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> very discreetly.
    We were much incommoded for want of Kettles, but Monsieur <i>de
    Beaujeu</i> gave Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> one, and he order’d another
    to be brought from the Bark <cite>la Belle</cite>, by which means we were
    well serv’d.</p>

  <p>We were still in want of Canoes. Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> sent to
    the Camp of the <i>Indians</i> to barter for some, and they who went
    thither observ’d, that those People had made their Advantage of our
    Ship-wreck, and had some Bales of <i>Normandy</i> Blankets, and they
    saw several Women had cut them in two and made Petticoats of them. They
    also saw Bits of Iron of the Ship that was cast away, and return’d
    immediately to make their Report to Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, who
    said we must endeavour to get some Canoes in Exchange, and resolv’d to
    send thither again the next Day. Monsieur <i>du Hamel</i>, Ensign to
    Monsr. <i>de Beaujeu</i>, offer’d to go up in his Boat, which Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i> agreed to, and order’d Messieurs <i>Moranget</i>, his
    Nephew, <i>Desloges</i>, <i>Oris</i>, <i>Gayen</i>, and some others to
    bear him Company.</p>

  <p>No sooner were those Gentlemen, who were more Hot than Wise, landed,
    but they went up to the Camp of the <i>Indians</i>,<span class="sidenote">Indiscretion of an Ensign.</span> with their Arms in
    their Hands, as if they had intended to force them, whereupon several
    of those People fled. Going into the Cottages, they found others, to
    whom Monsieur <i>du Hamel</i> endeavor’d to signify by Signs, that he
    would have the Blankets they had found restor’d; but the Misfortune
    was, that none of them understood one another. The <i>Indians</i>
    thought it their best Way to withdraw, leaving behind them some
    Blankets and Skins of Beasts, which those Gentlemen took away, and
    finding some Canoes in their Return they seiz’d two, and got in, to
    bring them away.</p>

  <p>But having no Oars, none of them knowing how to manage those Canoes,
    and having only some pitiful Poles, which they could not tell the
    right Use of, and the Wind being also against them, they made little
    Way; which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span> Sieur <i>du Hamel</i>, who was in his Boat perceiving,
    and that Night drew on, he made the best of his Way, forsook them and
    return’d to the Camp.</p>

  <p>Thus Night came upon them, which oblig’d those unexperienc’d Canoe
    Men, being thoroughly tir’d, to go ashore to take some Rest, and the
    Weather being cold, they lighted a Fire, about which they laid them
    down and fell asleep; the Sentinel they had appointed doing the same.
    The <i>Indians</i> returning to their Camp,<span class="sidenote">The <em>Indians</em> take Revenge.</span> and perceiving our Men:
    had carry’d away two Canoes, some Skins and Blankets, took it for a
    Declaration of a War, resolv’d to be reveng’d, and discovering an
    unusual Fire, presently concluded that our men had halted there. A
    considerable Number of them repair’d to the Place, without making the
    least Noise, found our careless People fast asleep, wrap’d up in their
    Blankets, and shot a full Volley of their Arrows upon them all together
    on a Sudden, having first given their usual Shout before they fall on.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Sieurs <em>Oris</em> and <em>Desloges</em> kill’d.</span>The Sieur <i>Moranget</i> awaking with the Noise, and finding
    himself wounded, started up and fir’d his Piece successfully enough,
    some others did the like, whereupon the Natives fled. The Sieur
    <i>Moranget</i> came to give us the Alarm, though he was shot through
    one of his Arms, below the Shoulder, and had another slanting Wound
    on the Breast. Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> immediately sent some arm’d
    Men to the Place, who could not find the <i>Indians</i>, but when Day
    appear’d, they found the Sieurs <i>Oris</i> and <i>Desloges</i> dead
    upon the Spot, the Sieur <i>Gayen</i> much hurt, and the rest all safe
    and sound.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">March 1685</span>This Disaster, which happen’d the Night of the 5th of <i>March</i>,
    very much afflicted Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>; but he chiefly lamented
    Monsieur <i>Desloges</i> a sprightly Youth, who serv’d well; but
    in short, it was their own Fault, and contrary to the Charge given
    them, which was to be watchful and upon their Guard. We were under
    Apprehensions for Messieurs <i>Moranget</i> and <i>Gayen</i>, lest
    the Arrows should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span> poison’d. It afterwards appear’d they were not,
    however Monsieur <i>Moranget’s</i> Cure prov’d difficult, because some
    small Vessel was cut.</p>

  <p>The Consequences of this Misfortune, together with the Concern, most
    of the best Persons who had follow’d Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> were
    under,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> supported the Design of those who were for returning
    to <i>France</i> and forsaking him, of which Number were Monsieur
    <i>Dainmaville</i>, a Priest of the Seminary of St. <i>Sulpice</i>, the
    Sieur <i>Minet</i>, Engineer and some others. The common Discourses of
    Monsieur <i>de la Sale’s</i> Enemies tending to discredit his Conduct,
    and to represent the pretended Rashness of his Enterprize, contributed
    considerably towards the Desertion; but his Resolution prevailing, he
    heard and waited all Events with Patience, and always gave his Orders,
    without appearing the least discompos’d.</p>

  <p>He caus’d the Dead to be brought to our Camp, and bury’d them
    Honourably, the Cannon supplying the Want of Bells, and then consider’d
    of making some safer Settlement. He caus’d all that had been sav’d
    from the Shipwreck, to be brought together into one Place, threw up
    Intrenchments about it, to secure his Effects, and perceiving that the
    Water of the River, where we were, roul’d down violently into the Sea,
    he fancy’d that might be one of the Branches of the <i>Missisipi</i>,
    and propos’d to go up it, to see whether he could find any Tokens of
    it, or of the Marks he had left, when he went down by Land to the Mouth of it.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Debates between the Commanders.</span>In the mean Time, Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i> was preparing to depart:
    The Chevalier <i>de Aire</i> had many Conferences with Monsieur <i>de
    la Sale</i> about several things, the latter demanded of Monsieur
    <i>de Beaujeu</i>, particularly the Cannon and Ball which were aboard
    the <cite>Joly</cite>, and had <span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>been design’d for him; which Monsieur <i>de
    Beaujeu</i> refus’d, alledging that all those things lay at the Bottom
    of the Hold, and that he could not rummage it without evident Danger
    of perishing; tho’, at the same time, he knew we had Eight Pieces of
    Cannon and not one Bullet.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Mr. <em>de la Sale</em> much wrong’d.</span>I know not how that Affair was decided between them; but am sure he
    suffer’d the Captain of the Flyboat <cite>l’Aimable</cite> to imbark aboard
    Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i>, tho’ he deserv’d to be most severely
    punish’d, had Justice been done him. His Crew follow’d him, contrary
    to what Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i><span class="sidenote">Mr. <em>de Beaujeu</em> leaves him.</span> had promis’d, that he would not
    receive a Man of them. All that Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> could do,
    tho’ so much wrong’d, was to write to <i>France</i>, to Monsieur <i>de
    Seignelay</i>, Minister of State, whom he acquainted with all the
    Particulars, as I was inform’d, when I return’d, and he gave the Packet
    to Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu</i>, who sail’d away for <i>France</i>.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

  <p>Having lost the Notes I took at that time, and being forc’d to rely
    much upon Memory for what I now write, I shall not pretend to be
    any longer exact in the Dates, for fear of mistaking, and therefore
    I cannot be positive as to the Day of Monsieur <i>de Beaujeu’s</i>
    Departure, but believe it was the 14th of <i>March</i>, 1685.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">A Fort built.</span>When Monsr. <i>de Beaujeu</i> was gone, we fell to Work to make a
    Fort, of the Wreck of the Ship that had been cast away, and many
    Pieces of Timber the Sea threw up; and during that Time, several Men
    deserted, which added to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>Monsieur <i>de la Sale’s</i> Affliction. A
    <i>Spaniard</i> and a <i>French</i> Man stole away and fled, and were
    never more heard of. Four or five others follow’d their Example, but
    Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> having timely Notice, sent after them, and
    they were brought back. One of them was condemn’d to Death, and the
    others to serve the King ten Years in that Country.</p>

  <p>When our Fort was well advanc’d, Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i> resolv’d
    to clear his Doubts,<span class="sidenote">Monsr. <em>de la Sale</em> goes to discover up the
    River.</span> and to go up the River, where we were, to know
    whether it was not an Arm of the <i>Missisipi</i>, and accordingly
    order’d fifty Men to attend him, of which Number were Monsr.
    <i>Cavelier</i>, his Brother, and Monsr. <i>Chedeville</i>, both
    Priests, two Recolet Fryars, and several Voluntiers, who set out in
    five Canoes we had, with the necessary Provisions. There remain’d
    in the Fort about an hundred and thirty Persons, and Monsr. <i>de
    la Sale</i> gave me the Command of it, with Orders not to have any
    Commerce with the Natives, but to fire at them if they appear’d.</p>

  <p>Whilst Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i> was absent, I caus’d an Oven to be
    built, which was a great Help to us, and employ’d my self in finishing
    the Fort, and putting it in a Posture to withstand the <i>Indians</i>,
    who came frequently in the Night to range about us, howling like Wolves
    and Dogs; but two or three<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Musquet Shots put them to Flight. It
    happen’d one Night, that having fir’d six or seven Shot, Monsieur <i>de
    la Sale</i> who was not far from us, heard them, and being in Pain
    about it, he return’d<span class="sidenote">Returns.</span> with six or seven Men, and found all Things in a
    good Posture.</p>

  <p>He told us he had found a good Country, fit to sow and plant all Sorts
    of Grain, abounding in Beeves and wild Fowl;<span class="sidenote">Sets out again.</span> that he design’d to erect
    a Fort farther up the River,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and accordingly, he left me Orders to
    square out as much Timber as I could get, the Sea casting up much upon
    the Shore. He had given the same Orders to the Men he had <span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>left on the
    Spot, seven or eight of whom, detach’d from the rest, being busy at
    that Work, and seeing a Number of the Natives, fled, and unadviseably
    left their Tools behind them. Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> returning
    thither, found a Paper made fast to a Reed, which gave him Notice of
    that Accident, which he was concern’d at, because of the Tools, not
    so much for the Value of the Loss, as because it was furnishing the
    Natives with such Things as they might afterwards make Use of against us.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Apr. 1685</span>About the Beginning of <i>April</i> we were alarm’d by a Vessel which
    appear’d at Sea,<span class="sidenote">A Spanish Vessel appears.</span> near enough to discern the Sails, and we supposed
    they might be <i>Spaniards</i>, who had heard of our Coming and were
    ranging the Coast to find us out. That made us stand upon our Guard,
    to keep within the Fort, and see that our Arms were fit for Service.
    We afterwards saw two Men in that Vessel, who<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> instead of coming to
    us, went towards the other Point, and by that Means pass’d on, without
    perceiving us.</p>

  <p>Having one Day observ’d, that the Water work’d and bubbled up, and
    afterwards perceiving it was occasion’d by the Fish skipping from
    Place to Place, I caused a Net to be brought, and we took a prodigious
    Quantity of Fish,<span class="sidenote">Plenty of Fish taken.</span> among which were many <i>Dorado’s</i> or Gilt-Heads,
    Mullets and others about as big as a Herring, which afforded us good
    Food for several Days. This fishery, which I caused to be often
    follow’d, was a great Help towards our Subsistance.</p>

  <p>About that Time, and on <i>Easter-day</i> that Year, an unfortunate
    Accident befell Monsieur <i>le Gros</i>. After Divine Service he took
    a Gun to go kill Snipes about the Fort. He shot one, which fell into
    a Marsh; he took off his Shoes and Stockings to fetch it out, and
    returning, through Carelessness trod upon a Rattle Snake,<span class="sidenote">Rattle Snake bites Mr. <em>le Gros</em>.</span> so call’d,
    because it has a Sort of Scale on the Tail, which makes a Noise. The
    Serpent bit him a little above the Ankle, he was carefully <span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>dress’d and
    look’d after, yet after having endur’d very much, he dy’d at last, as
    I shall mention in its Place. Another more unlucky Accident befell us,
    one of our Fishermen swimming about the Net to gather the Fish, was
    carry’d away by the Current, and could not be help’d by us.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">May 1685</span>Our Men sometimes went about several little Salt Water Lakes, that
    were near our Fort, and found on the Banks a Sort of flat Fishes, like
    Turbots asleep, which they struck with sharp pointed Sticks, and they
    were good Food. Providence also shew’d us that there was Salt made by
    the Sun,<span class="sidenote">Salt found in Pools.</span> upon several little Salt Water Pools there were in divers
    Places, for having observ’d that there grew on them a Sort of white
    Substance, like the Cream upon Milk, I took care every Day to send and
    fetch that Scum off, which prov’d to be a very white and good Salt,
    whereof I gather’d a Quantity, and it did us good Service.</p>

  <p>Some of our Hunters having seen a Parcel of wild Goats running as if
    they were frighted, judg’d they were pursued by the <i>Indians</i>,
    and came for Refuge to the Fort, and to give me Notice. Accordingly
    some Time after, we discover’d a Parcel of Natives, who came and posted
    themselves on an Eminence, within Cannon Shot, some of them drew
    off from the rest and approach’d the Fort<span class="sidenote"><em>Indians</em> come to the Fort.</span> by the Way of the Downs.
    I caused our Men immediately to handle their Arms, and wet Blankets
    to be laid on our Huts, to prevent their being burnt by the Fire the
    Savages sometimes shoot with their Arrows. All this Time those who
    had separated themselves from the rest, being three in Number, still
    drew nearer, making Signs for us to go to them; but Monsieur <i>de la
    Sale</i> had forbid me having any Commerce with them; however, since
    they had neither Bows nor Arrows, we made signs to them to draw near,
    which they did without hesitating.</p>

  <p>We went out to meet them. Monsieur <i>Moranget</i> made them sit
    down, and they gave us to understand by Signs, that their People were
    hunting near us; being able to make no more of what they said. Monsieur
    <i>Moranget</i> was for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span> knocking out their Brains, to revenge their
    having murder’d our Companions, but I would not consent to it, since
    they had come confiding in us. I made Signs to them to be gone, which
    they did as fast as they could, some small Shot we fir’d into the
    Air making them run, and a Cannon Shot, I pointed towards the rising
    Ground, where the rest were, put them all to Flight.</p>

  <p>These Accidents made us double our Guards, since we were at open War
    with that crafty Nation, which let slip no Opportunity to surprize us,
    and therefore Penalties were appointed for such as should be found
    asleep upon Sentinel; the Wooden-Horse was set up for them without
    Remission; and by Means of such Precautions we sav’d our Lives.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">June 1685</span>Thus we spent the rest of the Month, till the Beginning of <i>June</i>.
    In the mean Time, Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had begun to make another
    Settlement,<span class="sidenote">Second Settlement.</span> in the Place he before told us of, looking upon it as
    better, because it was further up the Country.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> To that Purpose he
    sent to us the Sieur <i>de Villeperdry</i> with two Canoes and Orders
    for the Sieur <i>Moranget</i> to repair to him, if he were recover’d,
    and that all the Men should march, except 30 of the ablest to make a
    good Defence, who were to stay with me in the Fort. The rest being
    seventy Persons, as well Men and Women as Children, set up with the
    Sieur <i>Moranget</i>; and we being but a small Number remaining, I
    caused the Fort to be brought into a less Compass, to save posting so
    many Sentinels.</p>

  <p>Our little Company began to take Satisfaction in the Ease of getting
    and the Nature of our Provisions, which a greater Number has more
    Difficulty to be supply’d with, and which we had Plenty of, by Means
    of Hunting and Fishing, those being our principal Employments, and we
    liv’d well enough contented, expecting to be remov’d. However there
    were some Malcontents,<span class="sidenote">A Conspiracy discover’d.</span> who resolv’d to desert; but finding a Difficulty
    to put it in Execution, for that they could <span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>neither get Arms, nor
    Powder nor Ball, because the Sieur <i>le Gros</i> and I kept all lock’d
    up, and were very vigilant, that none might be lavishly spent, they
    took the cruel Resolution to rid themselves of us.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">July 1685</span>That bloody Massacre was to begin by me, when I was asleep, and then
    to proceed to the Sieur <i>le Gros</i>, who lay in the Magazine, or
    Warehouse, and was in no Condition to defend himself, because his Leg
    was still swollen, and put him to much Pain. The Execution was to
    be by stabbing. One of the Conspirators reveal’d this to the Sieur
    <i>Devault</i>, a Hunter, who immediately came and acquainted me. I
    did not just then take Notice of what I had been told; but in the
    Evening, when they return’d from hunting, I caused one to be secur’d,
    who presently confess’d all. His Accomplice was also seiz’d, and it was
    very troublesome to secure them till the Time when we should remove.</p>

  <p>About the Middle of <i>July</i>, the Bark <cite>la Belle</cite> came and
    anchor’d near us. An Order was brought me from Monsieur <i>de la
    Sale</i>, directing me to put aboard it all the Effects that were in
    our Fort, to make a Float of the Timber I had caused to be squar’d, if
    Time would permit, if not to bury it in the Ground. Every Man set his
    Hand to the Work, with all possible Diligence, and our two Prisoners
    were put aboard, as was also Monsieur <i>le Gros</i> and his Surgeon,
    with all our Effects.</p>

  <p>The Float was begun with immense Labour; but the Weather proving very
    Stormy, and holding very long, I was oblig’d to cause what had been
    done to be taken in Pieces, and to bury the Timber in the Sand, the
    best we could, that the Natives might not find it.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">The First Fort abandon’d.</span>We then set out towards the Place where the <i>Indians</i> had been
    encamp’d, when Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> went the first time to see
    them. We found no Creature, and lay there that Night, and so proceeded
    along the Sea Coast, without any Accident, to the Camp of the Sieur
    <i>Hurie</i>, which was a Post in the Way, where Monsieur <i>de la
    Sale</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span> had order’d all our Effects to be laid up. It had no other
    Inclosure but Chests and Barrels; but there was nothing to fear from
    the <i>Europeans</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Ill posture of the 2d. Settlement.</span>We spent the Night at that Post, and two Canoes coming thither the
    next Morning, I went aboard one of them, with Part of my Company, and
    join’d Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> the next Day, at the Place where
    he had resolv’d to make his new Settlement. I gave him an Account of
    all that had happen’d, and was amaz’d to see Things so ill begun and
    so little advanc’d. As for the Plantation, the Seed and Grain put
    into the Ground, was either lost through Drought, or eaten by Birds
    or Beasts. There were several Dead, and among them the Sieur <i>de
    Villeperdry</i>; many sick, and of that Number Monsieur <i>Cavalier</i>
    the Priest; no Shelter but a little square Place stak’d in, where the
    Powder was and some Casks of Brandy; many other Inconveniences there
    were, which made all Things appear in a miserable Condition.</p>

  <p>It was requisite to think of building a large Lodgement, Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i> design’d it, but the Difficulty was to get proper
    Timber for Building. There was a little Wood, where a good Quantity
    might be had, but it was a League up the Country, and we had neither
    Carts nor Horses to carry it; however Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i> sent
    Workmen thither, with others to guard them.<span class="sidenote">Hard Labour.</span> The Trees were cut down
    and squar’d, but the Carpenters were so ignorant, that Monsr. <i>de
    la Sale</i> was forc’d to act the Master Builder, and to mark out the
    Pieces for the Work he design’d. Some of those Pieces of Timber were
    dragg’d to the Camp, over the Grass and Weeds the Plain was cover’d
    with; afterwards the Carriage of a Gun was made use of; but all cost so
    much Labour, that the ablest Men were quite spent.</p>

  <p>This excessive Toil, the poor Sustenance the labouring Men had, and
    that often retrench’d as a Penalty for having fail’d in doing their
    Duty; the Uneasiness Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> was under to see
    nothing succeed as he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span> imagin’d, and which often made him insult
    the Men, when there was little Reason for it; All these things together
    afflicted very many so sensibly, that they visibly declin’d, and above
    thirty dy’d. The Loss of so many Men was follow’d by that of the Master
    Carpenter,<span class="sidenote">Carpenter lost.</span> who was returning one Evening with me; but I happening to
    step aside to kill some wild Fowl, when I came to our Habitation I
    found him not, and it was never known what became of him; an Accident
    which added to our Vexation, for tho’ he had but little Skill at his
    Trade, yet we stood in Need of him.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Aug. 1685</span>Notwithstanding all those Disappointments, enough Timber was carry’d
    or rather dragg’d, to build the House Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>
    designed, and he was himself the Architect. He mark’d out the Lengths,
    the Tenants and Mortises, and made good the Defect of the Workmen and
    calling to Mind that I had bury’d several Pieces of Timber at our first
    Habitation, which might be of Use, he order’d me to take two Canoes and
    20 men, to go fetch them, in the Bark <cite>la Belle</cite>, which was with us.</p>

  <p>Being come to the Place, we found the Natives had discover’d our
    Timber, and carry’d away some Planks, to pick out the Nails there were
    in them, which they value very much, to point their Arrows. We labour’d
    to make a Float, loaded the Bark <cite>la Belle</cite> with the rest of
    the Planks and other Effects, and set out again. Some of the Natives
    appear’d whilst we were at Work, but seeing us advance towards them,
    with our Arms in our Hands, they fled.</p>

  <p>We return’d safe to Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, who was glad to see
    us, tho’ we had lost one of the Canoes,<span class="sidenote">Second Settlement.</span> for want of its being well
    made fast to the Float; but the Timber we brought was a mighty help
    towards carrying on his Design, and much fitter than that we had hew’d
    in the Wood, with so much Labour; so that this Timber occasion’d the
    raising another Structure contiguous to the former. All was cover’d
    with Planks, and Bullocks Hides over them. The Apartments were divided,
    and all of them well cover’d.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span> The Stores had a Place apart, and that
    Dwelling had the name of St. <i>Lewis</i> given it, as well as the
    Neighbouring Bay.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Sep. 1685</span>The Sieur <i>le Gros</i>,
    <span class="sidenote">Mr. <em>le Gros</em> dies and others.</span>who had remain’d aboard the Bark <cite>La

    swelling, the Surgeon was apprehensive of a Mortification, and advis’d
    him to consent to have it cut off. He did so, tho’ with Regret, the
    Operation was made, but a Fever follow’d immediately, and he liv’d
    but two Days, dying on the Feast of the Decollation of St. <i>John
    Baptist</i>, much lamented by all Men, and particularly by Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i>, to whom he was very serviceable, by reason of his
    general Knowledge, and his particular Fidelity towards him. Monsieur
    <i>Carpentier</i>, Son to the Master of the Works and the Sieur
    <i>Thibault</i>, both of Roan, and some others, dy’d about the same time.</p>

  <p>Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> being desirous to take a Progress, to find
    his fatal <i>Missisipi</i> River, and only expecting the Recovery of
    his Brother Monsieur <i>Cavalier</i>, who was to bear him Company, he
    began to make some Preparations towards it, and in the mean time, took
    some small Journeys of four or five Leagues about, but could learn
    nothing further, than that it was a very fine Country, hem’d in on one
    Side by a small Mountain, which appear’d at about Fifteen or Twenty
    Leagues distance; beautify’d with very fine Trees, and water’d by many
    little Rivers, whereof that, on which we had built our Habitation was
    the least. We call’d it <i lang="fr">la Rivière aux Bœufs</i>, that is the River
    of Bullocks,<span class="sidenote">River of Bullocks.</span> by reason of the great Number of them there was about it.
    These Bullocks are very like ours, there are Thousands of them, but
    instead of Hair they have a very long curl’d Sort of Wool.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

  <p>Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> Studying all Ways to find out the River
    <i>Missisipi</i>, imagin’d it might fall into the adjacent Bay, and
    resolv’d to go view all the Coasts about it, and to make use of the
    Bark <cite>la Belle</cite>. Accordingly he order’d me to repair to the said
    Bark, with five Men and a Canoe, into which he put his Cloaths, and
    other Effects in several Chests.</p>

  <p>That short Voyage was very troublesome to us, by reason of the foul
    Weather, with contrary Winds and Storms, which had like to have
    overwhelm’d us, and what was still worse, we did not find the Bark,
    where we had left her. We went on a League further, to no Purpose, and
    Provisions beginning to fall short, because we had been six Days on the
    Way, instead of three, we resolv’d to return to the Place from whence
    we came.</p>

  <p>Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> seeing us return at a distance, came to meet
    us. Our Report troubled him for the Bark, which he stood in need of, so
    that he resolv’d to go himself to seek her, imbark’d in a Canoe, and
    sent me another Way, in another. After having wander’d about all that
    Day, the next Night and the Day following, we at last perceiv’d her,
    where she lay under Shelter in a little Creek, having been in Danger of
    Perishing by the foul Weather we had been in, and had lost her Boat,<span class="sidenote">Boat of the Bark lost.</span>
    which was not well made fast.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Oct. 1685</span>The Bark was also discover’d by Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, who was on
    the other side, which made him draw near and land, whence he sent his
    Canoe to the said Bark, and Monsieur <i>Moranget</i> who commanded it,
    went aboard to meet him. The Loss of the Boat troubled Monsieur <i>de
    la Sale</i>, I sent a Canoe to bring him, but to no Purpose; however
    the Trunks were put aboard the Bark.</p>

  <p>Monsieur <i>Cavalier</i> the Priest, being recover’d Monsieur <i>de la
    Sale</i> prepar’d to set out with all Speed. He was pleas’d to Honour
    me with the Command, during his Absence, and left me an Inventory of
    all that was in our Habitation, consisting of Eight Pieces of Cannon,<span class="sidenote">What Stores they had.</span>
    two Hundred Firelocks, as many Cutlaces, an Hundred Barrels of Powder,
    three Thousand Weight of Ball, about three Hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span> Weight of other
    Lead, some Bars of Iron, twenty Packs of Iron to make Nails, some Iron
    Work and Tools, as Hatchets and the like.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Nov. 1685</span>As for Provisions, all that were left me amounted to twenty Casks of
    Meal, one Cask and a half of Wine, three Quarters of a Cask of Brandy,
    and for living Creatures some few Swine, a Cock and a Hen; which is
    very short of what has been Publish’d by the Author of a Book entitled,
    <cite>The first Establishment in New France</cite>: but the Reason of it is,
    that he compiled his Work upon the Credit of Relations, which were as
    false as to the Point of the Ammunition and Provisions, remaining in
    our Habitation, when Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> set out that Time, as
    concerning the Fort well condition’d, and the Magazines or Storehouses
    under Ground, which are all imaginary, there being Nothing but the
    House I have mention’d, pallisado’d, with some old Stakes.</p>

  <p>Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i> farther order’d me not to receive any Men of
    those he took along with him, unless they brought an Order from him in
    Writing; nor to hold or admit of any Communication with the Natives,
    but rather to fire upon them, and some other Particulars he thought fit
    to be observ’d. He had made himself a Coat of Mail with small Laths,
    to secure himself against the Arrows, which he took along with him, he
    also took the Canoes, and promis’d to send me one back. Five Cannon
    Shot were the Signal of his Departure.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Monsr. <em>de la Sale</em> goes out to discover.</span>He took his Way along the lower Part of the River, to march by Land
    along the neighbouring Bay, which was call’d of St. <i>Lewis</i>,<span class="sidenote">St. <em>Lewis’s</em> Bay.</span> the
    Canoes keeping within Sight. I was left in the Habitation with thirty
    four Persons, Men, Women and Children, and of that Number were three
    <i>Recolet</i> Friars, the Sieur <i>Hurie</i>, who was to command in my
    Absence, one of the Sieurs <i>Duhaut</i>, the Sieurs <i>Thibault</i>
    and a Surgeon.</p>

  <p>Our Provisions being very small, and it being requisite to spare them,
    for the Sick, we were oblig’d to apply our selves to Fishing and
    Shooting. Both of them at first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span> prov’d very unsuccessful, especially
    the latter; because we were not yet well vers’d in them, and Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i> had taken our Huntsman along with him; but at length,
    Necessity made us more expert. We kill’d Beeves, some of which I caus’d
    to be dry’d, and they were a considerable Help to subsist us.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Hunter dies with Cold.</span>Some Days after, the Canoe Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had promis’d me,
    arrived with three Soldiers, who brought us the News of the Loss of the
    Huntsman Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had taken along with him, and who
    had been found dead with Cold in a Ditch, where he had lain down to
    rest after hunting, which troubled us all very much. They also inform’d
    us, that Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i> advancing towards some Dwellings the
    Natives had abandon’d, after a small Resistance, some of whom had been
    wounded as they fled, they had taken and brought a Girl and a Woman,
    who was shot thro’ the Thigh, of which she dy’d.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Dec. 1685</span>The Canoe was a great Help to us to carry what we kill’d, which being
    brought to our Habitation, found Employment for all Persons, some to
    flea, others to cut up, and others to dry it. At other Times, I set
    some of our men to throw up a Trench about our Habitation.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Jan. 1686</span>Thus we spent our Time, till about the Middle of <i>January, 1686</i>,
    when being all, one Evening, in our Mansion, the Sentinel came
    in to acquaint me, that he heard a Voice towards the River; some
    men ran thither immediately, and found a Man in a Canoe, crying,
    <i>Dominick</i>, which was the Name of young <i>Duhaut</i>,<span class="sidenote"><em>Duhaut</em> returns from Mr. <em>de la Sale</em>.</span> who was
    with us. The Sight of that made me apprehensive lest some Disaster was
    befallen Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i>. I drew near, and perceiv’d it was
    <i>Duhaut</i> the Elder, that was return’d.</p>

  <p>I ask’d, him whether he had any Letters from Monsieur <span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span><i>de la
    Sale</i>, he answer’d he had not. It gave me some Uneasiness,
    considering I was forbid admitting any Man without an Order in Writing,
    and I was almost resolv’d to secure him; but the Account he gave me of
    the Occasion of his returning wholly clear’d him. I admitted him, and
    he told me the whole Matter as follows.</p>

  <p>Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i>, having staid some Time on the Sea Shore, near
    the Place where the Bark was at Anchor he resolv’d to try the Anchoring
    Places of the Coasts round about, to know how near the Bark <cite>la
    Belle</cite> might come. To that Purpose he sent the Pilot with 5 of the
    best Men to sound.</p>

  <p>The Pilot did as he was order’d, he sounded and observed the proper
    Places to come near several Coasts. At Night he and his Men being in
    all likelyhood tir’d, they thought fit to go Ashore and lie upon the
    Land. They made a Fire, perhaps to dress some Meat; but neglecting
    to stand upon their Guard, they were surpriz’d, and all six of them
    kill’d<span class="sidenote">Six Men killed by Natives.</span> by the Savages; who also broke their Canoe, and thus reveng’d
    themselves for the Irruption Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i> had lately made
    among them.</p>

  <p>More Time being elaps’d than Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had allotted
    those Men to return, he grew uneasy, and went himself along the Coast,
    to see if any News could be had of them, and keeping along the Shore,
    he found the sad Remains of those unfortunate Wretches, whose Carcasses
    scatter’d about, were torn and almost devour’d by Wolves or Wild Dogs,
    a Spectacle which went to his Heart.</p>

  <p>However this Loss, which afflicted him, and particularly for the Sake
    of the Pilot, who was an able Man, did not quite cast him down; but
    exerting himself against his Misfortunes, he caus’d Flesh to be dry’d,
    and with that and the other Provisions he victuall’d the Bark <cite>la
    Belle</cite>. He caus’d it to advance into the Bay, put a good Number of
    Men on Board to secure it, among whom were Monsieur <i>Chedeville</i>,
    the Priest, and <i>Planterose</i> of <i>Roan</i>, and order’d them not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
    to stir from that Place till they heard from him, and not to go Ashore,
    unless with a good Guard and necessary Precautions.</p>

  <p>Next, he chose out Twenty Men, imbark’d on two Canoes he had left, and
    being come Ashore, caus’d the Canoes to be sunk in the River, and every
    Man to take up his Bundle, consisting of Arms, Tools, some Utensils for
    the Kitchin, a few Goods, to trade with the Natives, if he should find
    any sociable, and so advanc’d into the Country, to try if any Notice
    could be had of the <i>Missisipi</i>.</p>

  <p>After several Days March, they came to a good pleasant River, which
    they afterwards call’d <i>la Maligne</i>.<span class="sidenote"><em>La Maligne</em> River.</span> Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>
    marching at the Head of the Company, and having order’d Monsieur
    <i>Moranget</i> to keep in the Rear; it happen’d that <i>Duhaut</i>
    stopping to mend his Snapsack<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and his Shoes, which were in a bad
    Condition; the Sieur <i>Moranget</i> coming up, commanded him to March,
    he desired him to stay a little. <i>Moranget</i> would not, but held on
    his Way; <i>Duhaut</i> follow’d some Time after, but having stay’d too
    long, he could not overtake the Company, and found himself about Night
    fall in a Plain full of Weeds, where there were several Tracks of the
    Way Cattle had gone, but knew not which of them to take. He fir’d his
    Piece several Times, without hearing any thing of his Company, and was
    oblig’d to pass the Night in that same Place.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Strange Adventure.</span>In the Morning he shot again, spent the Day and Night again in that
    Place, so that not knowing what to do, he return’d the same Way he had
    gone, and after a Month’s March, for he travell’d only by Night, for
    Fear of meeting with the Savages, living upon what he kill’d with much
    Difficulty and Danger, having before spent all his own Provisions; at
    length after most unaccountable Hardships and Sufferings, he arriv’d
    at the Place where the Canoes had been sunk. He took one of them up,
    with incredible Labour, and too long to relate, and so came to our
    Habitation of St. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span><i>Lewis</i>. Thus it pleas’d God that he who was to
    be one of the Murderers of Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, should come off
    safe, and surmount almost infinite Dangers.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Feb. 1686</span>This Account, which seem’d to carry the Face of Probability, prevail’d
    with me to receive the Sieur <i>Duhaut</i>, and in Reality I could do
    no otherwise, and I made it my Business to examine into his Behaviour,
    but could find Nothing to lay to his Charge. We continued some Time
    longer as we had been before; during the which, I caus’d another little
    Wooden Structure to be made, of Timber, I had got together, and in it
    I lodg’d the Women and Maidens by themselves. Having hitherto said
    Nothing of the Situation of our Dwelling of St. <i>Lewis</i>, nor of
    the Nature of the Country we were in, I will here venture upon a plain
    but true Description.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Description of the Country and Dwelling at St. <em>Lewis</em>.</span>
    We were in about the 27th Degree of North Latitude, two Leagues up the
    Country, near the Bay of St. <i>Lewis</i> and the Bank of the River
    <i>aux Bœufs</i>, on a little Hillock, whence we discover’d vast and
    beautiful Plains, extending very far to the Westward, all level and
    full of Greens, which afford Pasture to an infinite Number of Beeves
    and other Creatures.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">The Land.</span>Turning from the West to the Southward, there appear’d other Plains
    adorn’d with several little Woods of several Sorts of Trees. Towards
    the South and East was the Bay, and the Plains that hem it in from
    the East; to the Northward, was the River running along by a little
    Hill,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>beyond which there were other large Plains, with some little
    Tufts of Wood at small Distances, terminating in a Border of Wood,
    which seem’d to us to be very high.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Living Creatures.</span>Between that little Hill and our Dwelling, was a Sort of Marsh, and in
    it Abundance of wild Fowl, as Curlies, Water-Hens and other Sorts. In
    the Marsh there were little Pools full of Fish. We had also an infinite
    Number of Beeves, wild Goats, Rabbits, Turkeys, Bustards, Geese, Swans,
    Feldifares, Plovers, Teal, Partridges and many other Sorts of Fowl fit
    to eat, and among them one call’d <i lang="fr">le grand Gosier</i>, or, the great
    Gullet, because it has a very large one; another as big and Fleshy as
    a Pullet, which we called the <em>Spatula</em>, because it’s Beak is
    shap’d like one, and the Feathers of it being of a pale Red, are very
    beautiful.</p>

  <p>As for Fish,<span class="sidenote">Fish.</span> we had several Sorts in the River and in the Lakes I have
    mention’d. The River afforded a Sort of Barbles, differing from ours in
    Roundness, in their having three Bones sticking out, one on the Back,
    the others on each Side of the Head, and in the Flesh, which is like
    Cod, and without Scales. The River supply’d us with Abundance of other
    Fishes, whose Names we know not. The Sea afforded us Oysters, Eeles,
    Trouts, a Sort of red Fishes and others whose long, sharp and hard Beak
    tore all our Nets.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Tortoises.</span>We had Plenty both of Land and Sea Tortoises, whose Eggs serv’d to
    season our Sauces. The Land Tortoises differ from those of the Sea,
    as being smaller, round, and their Shell more beautiful. They hide
    themselves in Holes they find or make in the Earth. It was looking for
    these Tortoises, that one of our Surgeons, thrust his Arm into a Hole,
    and was bit by some venomous Creature,<span class="sidenote">Venomous Creatures.</span> which we suppos’d to be a Sort
    of Toad, having four Feet, the Top of his Back sharp and very hard,
    with a little Tail. Whether it was this Creature, or a Snake, his Arm
    swelled very much, however he was cured by such Applications as were
    made Use of; but it cost him a Finger was cut off.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Rattle-Snakes.</span>Among the venomous Sorts of Snakes, as Vipers, Asps and others, whereof
    there are many, those call’d Rattle-Snakes <span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>are the most common. They
    generally lye among the Brambles, where they make a Noise by the Motion
    of two Scales they have at the End of their Tail, which is heard at a
    considerable Distance, and therefore they are call’d Rattle-Snakes.
    Some of our Men had eaten of them and found their Flesh was not amiss,
    and when we had kill’d any of them, our Swine made a good Meal.</p>

  <p>There are also many Alligators<span class="sidenote">Alligators.</span> in the Rivers, some of them of a
    frightful Magnitude and Bulk. I kill’d one that was between four and
    five Foot about, and twenty Foot in Length, on which our Swine feasted.
    This Creature has very short Legs, insomuch that it rather drags along
    than walks, and it is easy to follow the Tract of it, either among the
    Weeds or on the Sands, where it has been. It is very ravenous, and
    attacks either Men or Beasts, when they are within Reach in the River,
    and comes also ashore to seek for Food. It has this particular Quality,
    that it flies from such as pursue, and pursues those who fly from it. I
    have shot many of them dead.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Trees.</span>The Woods are composed of Trees of several Sorts. There are Oaks,
    some of them ever green and never without Leaves; others like ours in
    <i>Europe</i>, bearing a Fruit much like our Galls, and lose their
    Leaves in Winter, and another Sort not unlike ours in <i>France</i>,
    but the Bark of them thicker, these as well as the second Sort bear an
    Acorn, differing from ours both in Taste and Bigness.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Dangerous Fruit.</span>There is a Sort of Tree, which bears small Berries, which, when ripe,
    are red, and indifferent pleasant. It bears twice a Year, but the
    second Crop never ripens. There is another Tree, bearing a Fruit not
    unlike <i>Cassia</i>, in Taste and Virtue.</p>

  <p>There are others of the Sort I had seen in the Islands, whose Leaves
    are like Rackets, whence the Tree bears the Name. The Blossoms grow
    out about the Leaves, and of them comes a Fruit somewhat resembling
    Figs, but the Leaves and the Fruit are full of Prickles, which must
    be carefully rubb’d and taken off, before it is eaten, else they
    dangerously inflame the Mouth and the Throat, and may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span> prove mortal, as
    happen’d to one of our Soldiers, who had eaten of them too greedily,
    and without that Precaution.</p>

  <p>I have seen some Trees resembling the Palm, whose lofty and long
    Branches spread like that call’d the <em>Latanier</em>, bearing a Fruit,
    said to be indifferent good. Others the same Sort, but whose Leaves
    are like Gutters, harsh and so sharp pointed, that they will pierce
    the thickest Stuffs. This Tree has a Sprout on the Top, which shoots
    out Flowers in the Shape of a Nosegay, of a whitish yellow, and some
    of them at the Top of that Sprout have sixty or eighty Flowers hanging
    down, not unlike the Flower de Luce, and after those Flowers follows a
    Fruit as long as a Man’s Finger, and thicker than the Thumb, full of
    little Seeds, so that there is scarce any Thing but the Rhind fit to
    eat, the Taste whereof is sweet and delicate.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Vines.</span>There are Abundance of creeping Vines and others, that run up the
    Bodies and to the Tops of Trees, which bear plenty of Grapes, fleshy
    and sharp, not to compare to the Delicacy of ours in <i>Europe</i>; but
    we made Verjuice of them, which was very good in Sauce. Mulberry Trees
    are numerous along the Rivers, their Fruit is smaller, but sweeter and
    more delicious than ours; their Leaves are beautiful and large, which
    would be of good Use for feeding of Silk-worms.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Plants.</span>The Plains are strew’d with a Sort of small Sorrel, the Leaf whereof is
    like Trefoil, and the Taste of it sharp like ours. There are Abundance
    of small Onions, no bigger than the Top of a Man’s Finger, but very
    well tasted, and when the Heat has scorch’d up the Plains, that Plant
    shoots out first, and produces Flowers which look like an agreeable
    Enamel. Nothing is more beautiful than to behold those vast Plains,
    when the Blossoms appear; a thousand Sorts of different Colours,
    whereof many<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> have an agreeable Scent, adorn those Fields, and
    afford a most charming <span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>Object to the Eye. I have observed some that
    smelt like a Tuberose, but the Leaf resembles our Borage. I have seen
    Primroses, having a Scent like ours, <i>African</i> Gilliflowers, and a
    Sort of purple wind Flowers. The Autumn Flowers are almost all of them
    yellow, so that the Plains look all of that Colour.</p>

  <p>The<span class="sidenote ul">March 1686</span> Climate is mild and temperate, tho’ we were in about 27 Degrees
    of North Latitude, and yet the Seeds I caused to be sow’d did not
    thrive; whether it was because they had been soak’d in the Sea Water,
    or for any other Reason. Some came up pretty well, as Pompions, Melons,
    Parsnips and Endive; but the Beasts and the Insects, left us not much.
    When we come to the <i>Cenis</i> and have travers’d so many Nations
    as lay between us and them, I shall speak of the Religion, Manners,
    Cloathing, Houses and Customs of the Natives, wherein they differ but
    little from one another, tho’ of several Countries.</p>

  <p>Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had been now long gone, and we began to
    be in Pain for him, when about the Middle of <i>March 1686</i>,
    hapning to be on the Top of the House, I spied seven or eight Persons
    coming towards us. I presently ordered eight arm’d Men to follow me,
    to go meet them; and as soon as we drew near them, we knew Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i>, Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i>, his brother, Monsieur
    <i>Moranget</i>, his Nephew and five or six Men with them, the rest
    being gone another Way to find out the Bark <cite>la Belle</cite>, to give
    Notice of Monsieur <i>de la Sale’s</i> Arrival.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Monsieur <em>de la Sale</em> returns.</span>They were in a bad Condition, their Cloaths ragged, Monsieur
    <i>Cavelier’s</i> short Cassock hung in Tatters; most of them had not
    Hats, and their Linen was no better; however the Sight of Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i> rejoyc’d us all. The Account he gave us of his
    Journey reviv’d our Hopes, tho’ he had not found the fatal River, and
    we thought only of making ourselves as merry as we could. Only the
    Sight of the Sieur <i>Duhaut</i> interrupted it for some Time. Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i> ask’d me in an angry Manner, why I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span> receiv’d him,
    and <i>Duhaut</i> having given his Reasons, as I and my Men did,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> we
    were all satisfy’d.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">The Bark <em>la Belle</em> lost.</span>The next Day, the Sieurs <i>le Barbier</i>, <i>Bihorel</i>, <i>le
    Petit</i>, <i>Cavelier</i>, the Nephew, the Surgeon and others, whom
    Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had sent to find out and carry Advice to
    the Bark <cite>la Belle</cite>, return’d, and said they could not find her,
    which was another fresh Cause of Much Uneasiness to Monsieur <i>de
    la Sale</i>. He had been guilty of the Fault of putting aboard her,
    his Cloaths, his Linen, his Papers and all his best Effects, of all
    which he was then in the utmost Need. Besides, that Loss broke all
    the Measures he had concerted during his last Expedition, because he
    had resolv’d to cause the said Bark to go up one of the Rivers he
    had discover’d, to advance towards those Nations with whom he had
    contracted some Friendship, and to send me in the same Bark, with his
    Nephew <i>Moranget</i>, to the Islands to seek for some Assistance, or
    else to return by Sea to look for his River.</p>

  <p>All these Designs being disappointed, he resolv’d to set out a second
    Time, and travel by Land, to find out his River.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> He staid to rest
    him a while, and to provide for his Departure, but having neither Linen
    nor Cloaths, I supply’d him with some I had; I also afforded some Linen
    to Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i>, his Brother and Monsieur <i>Moranget</i>,
    his Nephew. All I had was at their Service, and I depriv’d myself of
    all that was fit for them, even to ten or twelve <span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>Pounds of strings of
    Beads and some Knives and Nails,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> which Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>
    took.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Apr. 1686</span>The Sieur <i>Duhaut</i>, having several Effects, as Linen, Hatchets and
    other Tools and Commodities, which had been sav’d from the Shipwreck,
    Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> took Linen to make Shirts, for such as
    wanted, as also the Tools they stood in Need of. The Cloaths belonging
    to Messieurs <i>Thibault</i>, <i>le Gros</i> and <i>Carpentier</i>, who
    were dead, were also distributed. A great Belt I had, serv’d to make
    Shoes for Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> and Monsieur <i>Cavelier.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Monsieur <em>de la Sale</em> sets out upon another
    Expedition.</span>All Things being thus provided, Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> took twenty
    Men along with him, among whom were Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> his
    Brother, F. <i>Anastasius</i> a Recolet, Monsieur <i>Moranget</i> his
    Nephew, the Sieurs <i>Bihorel</i>, <i>le Clerk</i>, <i>Hurier</i>,
    <i>Duhaut</i> the younger, <i>Hiens</i> his Surgeon, and his Servants.
    He left behind those, who were not fit to undertake that second
    Journey, among whom were little Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i><a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> his
    Nephew, the Sieur <i>Barbier</i>, <i>Canadien</i> and some others. Each
    of the Travellers made up his Pack, and they set out towards the latter
    End of <i>April 1686</i>,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> after having given me the necessary
    Orders, and we parted without Ceremony, Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>
    desiring it should be so.</p>

  <p>Some Days after he was gone, I heard a Voice towards the lower Part of
    the River, crying twice <i lang="fr">Qui vive</i>, or who are you for. I made
    that Way, and perceiv’d the Sieur <i>Chedeville</i> a Priest, the
    Sieur <i>de la Sablonniere</i>, and some others of those who had been
    put aboard the Bark <cite>la Belle</cite>, and were now in a Canoe. I ask’d
    abruptly what was become of the Bark, and was inform’d, our continual
    Misfortunes still pursuing us, that it had run aground on the other
    Side of the Bay.<span class="sidenote">What was saved of the Bark <em>la Belle</em>.</span> I caused the Canoe to be unloaded, there being in it,
    among other Things, Monsieur <i>de la Sale’s</i> Cloaths, Part of his
    Papers, some Linen, a small Quantity <span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>of Beads and thirty or forty
    Pound of Meal, which was all they had left.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">May 1686</span>
    <span class="sidenote">How the Bark was lost.</span>The next Day, Monsieur <i>de Chedeville</i> told me the Particulars
    of that Misfortune, and said, That having been some Time with the
    Bark, in the Place where Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had appointed
    them to wait, their Water falling short, they had thought fit to send
    the Boat ashore, with four or five Casks to fill; that the Sieur
    <i>Planterose</i> went in it with six of the best Men. That towards the
    Evening they saw the Boat coming back, but the Wind being contrary and
    Night coming on, they put out a Light, which going out and the Captain
    neglecting to put up another, in all Likelyhood the Boat could not see
    the Bark, and they never heard of it after, nor of any of those in it,
    who it was probable had all perish’d.</p>

  <p>That nevertheless, they continued some Days in the same Place, during
    which Time three or four of their Men died; and at last, having no
    Water, they eat up their Swine, before they died with Thirst, and
    resolv’d to weigh Anchor and draw near to the Dwelling; but having few
    Hands and those spent, and to add to their Misfortune the Wind proving
    contrary, they were drove to the other Side of the Bay, where they ran
    aground.</p>

  <p>That having no Boat, nor Men enough to land their Effects, they had
    endeavour’d to make a Float with some Casks and Planks, but that being
    ill made and join’d together, the first that went upon it had perish’d.
    That having made another Float better fastened together than the
    first, they had by that Means saved some Sails and Rigging, several
    inconsiderable Things, Linen, Cloaths and Papers belonging to Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i> and others, and then stay’d Ashore, expecting to
    hear some News, and had found a Canoe, being the same that was before
    lost on the Edge of the Bay, which had been drove to the other Side;
    and that Provisions at last beginning to fall short, they went aboard
    the said Canoe and came to us; fortunate in that they had not been
    discover’d by the Natives, during their Stay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> Ashore, which was for the
    Space of three Months, and in finding the Canoe to bring them back.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">June 1686</span>When Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> went away, the Sieur <i>Barbier</i> had
    taken upon him to go a hunting, as also to provide Bark to cover our
    Houses, instead of Hides, because the Sun drying and contracting them,
    Part of the Top of our Buildings was uncover’d. I farther enjoyn’d him
    to cut Stakes, to make a Palisade about our Dwelling, and the Sieur
    <i>Chedeville</i> having told me they had bury’d several Things they
    could not bring away, I sent the Sieur <i>Barbier</i> with two Canoes
    and fifteen Men to the Place, where they found some Pedreroes,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
    Rigging and Sails. The Natives having discover’d the Concealment, had
    taken away some Pieces of Linen and Iron Tools, which they very much covet.</p>

  <p>The Sieur <i>Barbier</i> after his Return, continuing his Exercise of
    hunting, happen’d to meet with a Parcel of the Natives,<span class="sidenote">Encounter with the Natives.</span> some of whom
    had Firelocks, which they had taken from our Men, and with which they
    made some Shots at him, but very weak; and he firing three or four
    Shot at them they retir’d. He was then in a Canoe on the River, and
    design’d to have gone upwards; but that Rancounter having oblig’d him
    to take another Way, and the Savages perceiving it, eight of them swam
    over the River, hastening to get before the Canoe, hid themselves among
    the Weeds, near the Way he was to pass, and when he was near enough,
    let fly their Arrows, which wounded several Men. One Shot the Sieur
    <i>Barbier</i> made, put them all to Flight again; he held on his Way
    and return’d to our Habitation.</p>

  <p>Some Days after, we perceiv’d a Herd of Bullocks flying, and guess’d
    they were pursu’d by the Savages, which afterwards appear’d to be true.
    Some of them drew near to our Habitation, but a Cannon Shot, I pointed
    towards the Gang of them, and a Musket-shot Monsieur <i>Barbier</i>
    fired at the nearest, made them all fly farther off.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

  <p>When the Sieur <i>Barbier</i> went out a Hunting, I commonly sent with
    him some Women and Maids, to help the Hunters to dress and dry the
    Flesh; but being inform’d that he us’d to slip aside from the Company,
    <span class="sidenote">The Sieur <em>Barbier</em> marries.</span>
    with a young Maid he had a Kindness for, and which gave Occasion to
    some well-grounded Railleries; the said <i>Barbier</i> being told I was
    acquainted with that Affair, came and spoke to me in private, desiring
    Leave to marry that young Woman. I made some Difficulty of it at first,
    advising him to stay till Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> return’d; but at
    last, considering they might have anticipated upon Matrimony, I took
    the Advice of the Recolet Fathers, and of Monsieur <i>Chedeville</i>
    the Priest, and allowed them to marry. Monsieur <i>le Marquis de la
    Sabloniere</i> following this Example, ask’d the same Liberty, being
    in Love with a young Maid, which I absolutely refus’d, and forbid them
    seeing one another.</p>

  <p>Some Time pass’d in which Nothing happen’d to us worth observing;
    however, I will mention two Things which befell our Recolet Fathers.
    <span class="sidenote">Accidents concerning the Recolets.</span>
    One was, That Father <i>Anastasius</i>, being a hunting Bullocks with
    me, and coming too near one I had shot, and was fallen, the Beast, as
    much hurt as he was, started up, attack’d and threw him down; he had
    much ado to get off, and I to rescue him, because I durst not shoot for
    Fear of killing him. The Bullock being weak, fell again; the Father
    was deliver’d, but lay ill some Months. The other was, That Father
    <i>Maximus</i> had writ some Memoirs concerning Monsieur <i>de la
    Sale’s</i> Conduct, condemning him upon several Occasions. I was told
    of it, found Means to get those Memoirs, threw them into the Fire, and
    so the Father came off.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote"><em>Duhaut</em> Endeavours to occasion a Mutiny.</span>
    About the same Time, most of our Men seeing Monsieur <i>de le Sale</i>
    did not return, began to mutter. The Sieur <i>Duhaut</i>, who perhaps
    had been the first Fomenter of those Discontents, back’d the Complaints
    of the disgusted Party, promis’d them great Matters under his Conduct,
    and offer’d to supply them with such Effects as he had in Possession,
    endeavouring, as I suppose, by those Means, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span> gain their Affections,
    for a mischievous Design, which it is likely he had even then conceiv’d.</p>

  <p>It was not long before, I had Intimation of the whole Affair, and I
    had done Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> a singular Piece of Service, had I
    then put to Death the Person, who was to be his Murderer; but I rested
    satisfy’d with giving him a severe Reprimand, and threat’ning to cause
    him to be secur’d if he persisted, being able to do no other under my
    present Circumstances. However, I talk’d to all concern’d, and put them
    in such Hopes of Monsieur <i>de la Sale’s</i> Return, and that Things
    would soon change to their Satisfaction, that they were all pacify’d.</p>

  <p>But in Regard, that Idleness often occasions Uneasiness and Impatience,
    I us’d all possible Means to keep them employ’d, in the most obliging
    Manner I could, setting some to cut down the Bushes about our Dwelling,
    others to hew down Trees, that hinder’d the Prospect, others mow’d the
    Grass, that fresh might grow up for our Cattle, and at Night I made
    them divert themselves with Dancing and Singing.</p>

  <p>Whilst we thus pass’d away the Time the best we could, Monsieur <i>de
    la Sale</i><span class="sidenote">M. <em>de la Sale’s</em> Discoveries.</span>
    had penetrated very far up into the Country, inclining
    towards the Northern Part of <i>Mexico</i>. He had travell’d through
    several Nations, the Inhabitants whereof were, for the most Part,
    sociable, and had concluded a Sort of Alliance with them, and
    particularly with the <i>Cenis</i> and others whose names I shall
    mention. He had discover’d charming Countries abounding in all Things
    that could be wish’d, as well for Sustenance, as for making of easy
    Settlements, and after he and his Nephew <i>Moranget</i> had escap’d
    two Dangerous Sicknesses, he return’d to our Habitation, with five
    Horses he had purchas’d, and arriv’d at it in <i>August 1686</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">His Return.</span>Hearing of his Voice, I was one of the first that ran towards the
    River: We took our Canoes to bring him, his Luggage and some Provisions
    over, and the Horses swam. We were extraordinary glad to see our
    Commander in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span> Chief return safe, tho’ his Journey had not advanc’d
    his Design. Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had not found out his River,
    nor been towards the <i>Islinois</i> as we had hoped. Only eight
    Men return’d with him of twenty he carry’d out, and all the visible
    advantage of that Journey consisted in five Horses, laden with Indian
    Wheat, Beans and some other Grain, which was put into the Store.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Sept. 1686</span>
    <span class="sidenote">7 Men lost and 4 desert.</span>
    Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i> ask’d me, as soon as he came, whether the
    Sieurs <i>Clerc</i>, <i>Hurie</i>, <i>Duhaut</i> the younger and two
    others were come, because they not being able to endure the Fatigue of
    the Journey, he had given them Leave to return, and hearing they were
    not, he concluded the Savages had killed them. We were also inform’d,
    that the Sieur <i>Bihorel</i>, had stray’d and was lost, so that there
    had been no News of him since; that one of Monsr. <i>de la Sale’s</i>
    Servants had been dragg’d down to the Bottom of the Water and devour’d
    by an Alligator, and that four others had deserted and abandon’d
    Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, when he was about the Country of the <i>Cenis</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">M. <em>de la Sale</em> resolves upon a third
    Expedition.</span>This was a very dismal and deplorable Account; but the even Temper of
    our Chief made all Men easy, and he found, by his great Vivacity of
    Spirit, Expedients, which reviv’d the lowest Ebb of Hope. He rejoiced
    at the Return and Sight of M. <i>Chedeville</i>, he was pleas’d at
    the Recovering of his Cloaths and Part of his Papers; and after
    some Time of Rest, he propos’d to undertake a Journey towards the
    <i>Islinois</i>, and to make it the main Business, by the Way, to find
    the <i>Missisipi</i>; but it was thought proper to let the great Heats
    pass, before that Enterprize was taken in Hand.</p>

  <p>In the mean Time, he gave Orders to stake about a Place to make a New
    Magazine, or Storehouse. He put to that Use the Timber I had caus’d
    to be cut, and would have more provided for the same Use. Detachments
    being sent to work, seven or eight of our Men, who were sent with
    the Sieur <i>Barbier</i>, were discover’d by the Savages, who being
    superior in Number, made as if they would hem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span> them in; but each of
    our Men having taken a Tree upon their Shoulders and fir’d their
    Pieces, which made one of the Natives drop, the others took him up
    and withdrew. Yet it was not long before they were reveng’d, for they
    kill’d us two Men,<span class="sidenote">Two Men kill’d.</span> one of them close by our Dwelling, and the other,
    who had separated from the rest of the Company to gather Purslain, and
    could not be reliev’d.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Oct. 1686</span>There being every Day some Discourse of the Journey to the
    <i>Islinois</i>, Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> ask’d me one Day, whether
    I would make one of the Company, and go by the Way of <i>Canada</i> to
    <i>France</i> for Succours. I assured him I was entirely devoted to
    his Will, and would faithfully attend him. Then he began by Degrees
    to provide what he thought necessary for that Expedition. I had two
    Pair of Sheets, which he took, to make him Linen. Canvas Cloaths were
    made of the Sails of the Bark <cite>la Belle</cite>. The Sieur <i>Duhaut</i>
    having Linen, he took some to distribute among several Persons. Thus he
    hasted on the Expedition of his Design, but an Accident put it off.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Nov. 1686</span>It was occasion’d by a Flux which troubled Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>,
    who having told me he could not perform that Journey, as long as he
    continued in such condition, I offer’d to undertake it for him, if
    he would allow me his <i>Indian</i>, and about fifteen Men; but he
    answer’d, That his Presence was requisite among the <i>Islinois</i>,
    and that it was requisite his Brother should go to <i>France</i>. Thus
    he refus’d my Offer, and could not shun the ill Fate of that Journey.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Dec. 1686</span>We spent some Time longer after this Manner, during the which, there
    arose a Controversy about the Privileges<span class="sidenote">Controversy about Privilege.</span> the King grants to the
    First-born of the <i>French</i> Colonies in <i>America</i>. The Sieur
    <i>Barbier’s</i> wife was with Child, and he claim’d the Privilege
    granted for that Child. The Widow <i>Talon</i> had a Child born in the
    Passage from <i>France</i> to <i>America</i>, and alledg’d, that her
    Child, tho’ born before our Arrival, ought to be preferr’d; but the
    Sieur <i>Barbier’s</i> Wife miscarrying, the Dispute was not decided.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Jan. 1687</span>Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> being recover’d of his Indisposition,
    Preparations were again made for his Journey; but we first kept the
    <i>Christmas</i> Holy-Days. The Midnight Mass was solemnly sung, and on
    <i>Twelve-Day</i>, we cry’d, <i>The King drinks</i>, (<i>according to
    the Custom of</i> France) tho’ we had only Water: When that was over
    we began to think of setting out. Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> gave the
    Command of the Settlement to the Sieur <i>Barbier</i>, directing him
    what he was to do and observe in his Absence.</p>

  <p>There<span class="sidenote">Who were left in the Settlement when M. <em>de la Sale</em>
    departed.</span> remain’d in that Habitation, the Fathers <i>Maximus</i> and
    <i>Zenobius</i>, Recolets, Monsieur <i>Chedeville</i>, the Priest, the
    Marquis <i>de la Sablonniere</i>, the Sieur <i>Barbier</i>, Commander,
    his Wife, a Surgeon and others, to the Number of twenty, among whom
    were seven Women, or Maids, and only the Sieur <i>Barbier</i> marry’d;
    which is much short of the Number some have given out remain’d in the
    Dwelling, without any Ground; for the Truth is, there were no more, and
    particularly no Natives, Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> having absolutely
    forbid holding any Communication with them. As for Beasts, they
    amounted to seventy, or seventy five Swine, great and small, which was
    a good Stock; for Fowl, eighteen or twenty Hens; some Casks of Meal,
    which was kept for the Sick; Powder, Ball, and eight Pieces of Cannon,
    without any Bullets.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Persons that set out with M. <em>de la Sale</em>.</span>We set out the 12th of <i>January</i>, in the Year 1687, being
    seventeen in Number, <i>viz.</i> Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, Monsieur
    <i>Cavelier</i>, the Priest, his Brother, Father <i>Anastasius</i>,
    the Recolet, Messieurs <i>Moranget</i> and <i>Cavelier</i>, Nephews
    to Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, the Sieurs <i>Duhaut</i>, the Elder,
    <i>l’Arcleveque</i>,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> <i>Hiens</i>, <i>Liotot</i>, Surgeon, young
    <i>Talon</i>, an <i>Indian</i>, and a Footman belonging to Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i>. We carried along with us Part of the best Things
    every Man had, and what was thought would be of Use, wherewith the five
    Horses were loaded, and we took our Leaves with so much Tenderness and
    Sorrow, as if we had all presaged, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>that we should never see each other
    more. Father <i>Zenobius</i> was the Person who express’d it to me most
    significantly, saying, He had never been so sensibly touch’d at parting
    with any Body.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">The Way they travell’d.</span>We went that Day to the Place we call’d <i>le Boucon</i>, because
    there, we had often dry’d Flesh, (<i>which the French call</i>
    Boucanner <i>from the Indian Word</i>). This Place was not far from our
    Habitation. The 13th, we cross’d a Plain, about two Leagues over, where
    we saw several Herds of Beeves and Flocks of Goats, Turkeys, Bustards,
    and other Sorts of Wild Fowl. We met with Marshy Lands, which tired our
    Horses, and came to a Wood that terminates the Plain, across which,
    runs a Branch of a River, full of Reeds, by Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>
    call’d the <i>Princess’s</i> River. That Branch joins the other, and
    they both fell together into the Bay of St. <i>Lewis</i>.</p>

  <p>We kill’d five Beeves at the Entrance into the Wood, forded the River,
    and incamp’d Half a League beyond it, whence Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>
    sent Men with Horses, to bring the Flesh of the Bullocks we had kill’d;
    the Hides of them, which serv’d to cover us, being very useful against
    a violent Shower of Rain that fell.</p>

  <p>The 14th, the Rain ceasing, we travell’d over another spacious Plain,
    where there is a Multitude of Beeves and Wild Fowl. We saw several
    Tracks, leading every Way, made by the Bullocks, of which we saw
    several Herds, some moving on hastily, and others running out-right,
    which made us suppose they were drove by the Natives. In short,
    having halted to help up one of our Horses that was fallen, we saw an
    <i>Indian</i> following them very close. Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>
    caus’d a Horse to be immediately unloaded, which a Man mounting, rode
    after, overtook and brought the <i>Indian</i>.</p>

  <p>When the Savage saw himself among us, he concluded he was a lost Man,
    he quak’d for Fear, and not without Reason, for most of our Men had
    resolv’d to kill him; Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> oppos’d it, alledging,
    that we were but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> a small Number, that very few were left behind at
    the Habitation, and therefore we ought not to render our selves odious
    to the Natives, but to use them kindly, that we might have Peace; an
    infallible Maxim, the Practice of which might have been fortunate to
    him, had he follow’d it sooner.</p>

  <p>He therefore caus’d a Fire to be made, gave him to Eat and Smoke, and
    afterwards a Bit of Roll-Tabacco, and some other Trifles. Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i> gave him to understand, that he came not to hurt
    any Man, but to settle Peace in all Places, and so dismissed him. The
    <i>Indian</i> recover’d himself a little of his Fright; but being still
    dubious, what his Fate might be, he at first walk’d away gently, still
    looking about him, and when at a good Distance, made off as fast as he
    could. We held on our Way, and soon after saw another <i>Indian</i>
    running after the Bullocks. Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> caus’d him to be
    taken, brought to us, and treated as the first had been.</p>

  <p>We had not gone far before we spy’d a Company of Natives coming towards
    us, on our left, but we held on our Way, till they were over against
    us, when Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> caus’d us to halt. The Savages
    seeing us halt, stood still also, which Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>
    perceiving, he laid his Firelock on the Ground, and advanc’d towards
    them, making signs to him that Commanded them, who was a handsome Man,
    to draw near. That <i>Indian</i> came forward, and was follow’d by the
    rest, all of them Caressing us after their Manner, which we return’d
    the best we were able, and then made them Smoak.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Natives entertain’d.</span>Next Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> gave them to understand, that we were
    going towards the <i>Cenis</i>, that we desir’d to be at Peace with
    them all, and that we would return to our own Country, whence we would
    bring them all they had Occasion for. Then we distributed among them
    some Bits of Roll-Tabacco, some Strings of Beads and Knives, which they
    seem’d to be pleas’d with, and all this was done by Signs. Then every
    Man went his own Way: We advanc’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span> half a League farther, to get into a
    Wood, where Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had encamp’d when he went that
    Way before; we cut down Trees to secure our Post, and lay there that Night.</p>

  <p>Before our Intrenchment was finish’d, we discover’d, first one
    <i>Indian</i>, then two, and afterwards three, coming one after
    another; which giving Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> some Jealousy, he
    caus’d us to handle our Arms, with Orders to stand upon our Guard, for
    fear of being surpriz’d, and went towards them. They signify’d to him,
    that their People had told them, we did not hurt any Body, which was
    very well, and that they were come to see us. They were entertain’d
    as the others had been, and then Signs were made them to withdraw,
    because Night drew on, and having observ’d, that they took Notice of
    our fortifying our selves, we kept a good Guard all the Night, without
    any Disturbance.</p>

  <p>The Fifteenth, we march’d on, intending to find out a Ford, in the
    River call’d of the <i>Princess</i>, where Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>
    had pass’d before; but missing of it, and the River being swollen, we
    were oblig’d to go up higher, sometimes crossing curious<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Meadows,
    and sometimes Woods of tall Trees<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> of several Sorts, but all Young
    of the same Thickness and strait, looking as if they had been planted
    by a Line. <span class="sidenote">A fine Country.</span>The River running through the midst of those curious shady
    Groves,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> which were also water’d by several little Brooks of very
    clear and good Water, afforded a most delightful Landskip.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Thick Woods.</span>We also met with some Woods so thick, that it was requisite to hew a
    Passage for the Horses. Towards the Evening we kill’d a Bullock, and
    went to incamp in a little Coppice, with our usual Precautions.</p>

  <p>The 16th, we continued our Journey, still following the River upwards,
    and from Time to Time meeting the same <span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>Sort of Pasture Grounds<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
    and the Obstacles of Woods, where we were fain to cut our Way through,
    which fatigued us very much; but the Plenty of wild Fowl,<span class="sidenote">Wild Fowl.</span> and
    particularly of Turkeys, whereof we killed many, was an Ease to our
    Sufferings, and Help to bear our Toil with more Satisfaction.</p>

  <p>The 17th, was a very toilsome Day’s Journey, by Reason of the Woods and
    Rivulets we were to cross; after which we came to a little Hill,<span class="sidenote">An Indian Village abandon’d.</span> on
    which there were 2 or 300 Cottages of the Natives. Those Huts were like
    large Ovens, consisting of long Poles stuck in the Earth in a Circle,
    and joyning above to make the Dome or round Top.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> They had been a
    Dwelling of the Natives, who being gone, had carry’d away the Hides
    that cover’d them, and the Mats which are us’d to hang the Insides, and
    to make their beds of.</p>

  <p>After a March of some Hours, our <i>Indian</i> having found a Herd
    of Beeves, we kill’d seven or eight, took the best of the Meat, and
    held on our Way across a Wood. We ford’d a Branch of the River, and
    proceeded to the Bank of another, the Bottom whereof being foul,
    we incamp’d on the Edge of it, and the Rain falling at Night and
    continuing all the next Day, were oblig’d to stay there.</p>

  <p>The 19th, the Rain ceasing, we proceeded through a thick Fog, and over
    Places where the Water was often up to our Knees, and sometimes higher;
    which, together with our being forc’d to cut the Way athwart the
    Bushes, with our Hatchets, gave us inexpressible Trouble, and it had
    been much greater, had we not resolv’d to follow the Ways beaten by the
    Bullocks, whom a natural Instinct always leads to those Parts which are
    easiest to pass.</p>

  <p>We were not free from another Inconveniency in those Tracks, which was
    their being full of Water and very rugged, a Thing no Way agreeable to
    our Shoes,<span class="sidenote">Buskins of raw Hides instead of Shoes.</span> which were no other than a Piece of Bullocks Hide or Goats
    Skin <span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>quite green, whereof we made a sort of Buskins, to serve instead
    of Shoes, but when those wretch’d Boots were dry’d by the Heat, upon
    our Feet, they hurt us very much, and we were often oblig’d to set our
    Feet in the Water to soften those Buskins. However, we march’d all the
    Day, notwithstanding all those Inconveniences, without finding a proper
    Place to incamp, and at last came to a River, whose high Bank afforded
    us a Spot to rest on.</p>

  <p>The 20th, a small Rain did not obstruct our March, and having cross’d
    a Wood, half a League athwart, and a Marsh of the same Extent, we came
    into a large Plain, cut across by great Tracks of Bullocks, which
    went towards the River, and made us suppose there might be a Ford. We
    follow’d that Way, but found the River so swollen, and its Stream so
    rapid, that it was impossible to cross it, but were oblig’d to halt
    upon its Bank, whence we went to hunt Bullocks, whereof we had no want,
    nor of Turkeys and other wild Fowl.</p>

  <p>The 21th, we proceeded up that River, and found a narrow deep Place,
    near which we hew’d down a Tree, making it fall so as to reach from the
    one Bank to the other, in the Nature of a Plank, and handed our Baggage
    from one to another over it. The Horses swam over and we incamp’d on
    the other Side, near a very beautiful Plain.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote"><em>Hebahamo</em>, Indian Nation.</span>Whilst we were hewing down some little Wood to intrench ourselves,
    we heard a Voice, whereupon handling our Arms and going to the Place
    where we heard it, we saw a Company of fifteen Savages, who were coming
    towards us, and made Signs to us to go to them, laying down their
    Bows, in Token of Peace. We also made our Sign to them to draw near,
    they did so and caress’d us after their Manner. We made them sit down
    and smoke, after which, Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i> began to converse
    with them by Signs, and by Help of some Words of the Language of the
    <i>Cenis</i>, which he was skilful in, he understood, that these were
    their Neighbours and Allies; that their Village was not far off, and
    that their Nation was call’d <i>Hebahamo</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span> Some small Presents were
    given them, and they withdrew, promising to return the next Day.</p>

  <p>The 22th, our Horses being spent and hurt, and we much tir’d, the Day
    was given to Rest, and the Natives did not fail to come, being twenty
    five in Number, some of whom had Bucklers or Targets made of the
    strongst Part of the Bullocks Hides. They gave us to understand, that
    they were ingag’d in War towards the <i>N. W.</i> and told us, they had
    seen Men like us, who were but ten Days Journey from that Place. Other
    Tokens they gave, made us suppose it was <i>New Spain</i> that they
    talk’d of.</p>

  <p>Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i> took several Words of their Language, which
    is very different from that of the <i>Cenis</i>, and more difficult.
    As for their Customs, they are much alike. In fine, having shewn us,
    that towards the <i>N. W.</i> we should meet with Plains, where the Way
    would be easier, and we should shun the Woods, we gave them to eat, and
    some Presents, and they took Leave of us. A Rain falling and holding
    all the Night, we did not march the 24th. The 25th, we travell’d not
    far, by Reason of the Rains continuing, and that there were several
    Rivers in the Way much swollen.</p>

  <p>The 26th, we proceeded on our Journey, and came to the River call’d
    <i>la Sabloniere</i>, from the many Sand Banks there are in it. The
    27th,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> departing from it, we came to another little narrow River,
    but very deep; going up higher we found a Ford, and went to incamp
    beyond it, in a little Wood, where we had a very bad Night, because
    of the Rain which fell again, and the overflowing of the River, which
    oblig’d us to make a little Sort of Scaffold, to lay our Powder
    and Cloaths on, that they might not be wet. The next Day being the
    28th,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> observing that the Water was still rising, we decamp’d to go
    a League farther, to a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>higher Ground, where we made a great Fire to
    warm and dry us.</p>

  <p>We took Notice the Country was very good, the Plains extending as
    far as the Eye could reach, and adorn’d with many little Coppices,
    affording a very agreeable Prospect. We march’d over Part of them the
    29th and 30th, after 3 Hours Travel, found a Way full of Water, which
    oblig’d us to incamp on the Bank of a River; pass’d it the 31th, and
    incamp’d in a Wood close by.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Feb. 1687</span>The next Day, being the First of <i>February 1687</i>, Monsieur <i>de
    la Sale</i> left me to guard the Camp,<span class="sidenote">Village inhabited.</span> and took along with him,
    Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> his Brother and seven Men, to go see whether
    he could find any Body in several Cottages our Hunters had discover’d.
    He found twenty four or twenty five of them, built round like those I
    have before mention’d, standing on a rising Ground, almost encompass’d
    by the River, in each of which there were four or five Men, and several
    Women and Children.</p>

  <p>The Savages were somewhat surpriz’d at Monsieur <i>de la Sale’s</i>
    coming; however they receiv’d him in friendly Manner, and conducted him
    to their Commander’s Hut, which was immediately fill’d with People, who
    came to see him. The Elders came together there, Bullocks Hides were
    laid upon the Ground, on which they made Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> and
    his Company sit. They gave them hung Beef to eat, and then signify’d to
    them that some of their Allies had given them Notice of our being in
    the Country, and that we were going to the <i>Cenis</i>, and they had
    imagin’d that we would pass thro’ their Country.</p>

  <p>Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> present’d them with some Knives and Bits
    of Tabacco, and they gave him Bullocks Hides, very well dress’d with
    the Hair, they gave one for a Knife, and would have given many more,
    but that we told to them, that we had no Conveniency to carry them and
    that if they had any Horses, he would give them Axes in Exchange. They
    answer’d, they had but two, which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span> could not part with. It being
    late when Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> return’d, we staid there the rest
    of the Day, and several <i>Indians</i> came to see us, in Hopes of
    receiving some Present, offering us Bullocks Hides dressed, which we
    would not burden our selves with.</p>

  <p>The Second, we set out again, and halted some Time in that Village,
    where by the Way we barter’d for some Collars, or a Sort of Knots<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
    made of Bullocks Hides well dress’d, which the Natives make Use of to
    carry their Burdens, whether of Wood, Utensils, or the Meat they kill.
    They prov’d of Use both to us and our Horses, because the Thongs of
    those Collars serv’d to make fast our Burdens.</p>

  <p>We proceeded on our Journey, through a Country pleasant enough, but
    Sandy, and having cross’d a large Plain, came to the Bank of a fine
    River, call’d <i>la Maligne</i>,<span class="sidenote"><em>la Maligne</em> River.</span> or the Mischievous, because in
    Monsieur <i>de la Sale’s</i> former Journey, an Alligator devour’d one
    of his Servants, who was swimming over it. This River is as wide as the
    <i>Seine</i> at <i>Roan</i>, seems to be very navigable and has a very
    pleasant Country about it. We incamp’d in a little Wood adjoining to
    it, and bark’d the Aspen Trees to hut.</p>

  <p>Our Hunters kill’d Beeves, wild Goats, Turkeys and other Wild-Fowl, and
    among the rest some Creatures as big as an indifferent Cat, very like a
    Rat,<span class="sidenote"><em>Indian</em> Rats.</span> having a Bag under their Throat, in which they carry their Young.
    They feed upon Nuts and Acorns, are very fat, and their Flesh is much
    like Pig.</p>

  <p>Hard by there, we found a Place where Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, in
    his former Journey had hid some Parcels of Strings of Beads in the
    Trunks of Trees, and we rested there till the Eighth of the Month.
    During that Time, no Day pass’d without seeing some of the Natives, who
    sometimes spent the whole Day with us, and said they were of several
    Nations. We made them smoke, and always gave <span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>them some small Presents.
    They admir’d that after we had writ down some Words they spoke to us,
    we repeated them, looking on the Paper.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Portable Canoe.</span>Whilst we staid, Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> set Men at Work to make a
    portable Canoe, of long Poles, hew’d and joyn’d and then cover’d with
    Bullocks Hides sew’d together, having pull’d off the Hair or Wooll, as
    it may be call’d there. That Canoe was of great Use to us, to cross
    Rivers as well for our selves as for our Baggage, but the Horses swam over.</p>

  <p>The Ninth, we put our Canoe into the Water, and pass’d the River in
    it, and incamp’d half a League from thence, on Account of the Grass,
    which our Horses stood in Need of to recover themselves a little. The
    Tenth, we held on our Journey, crossing several spacious Plains, the
    Grass whereof was burnt, whence Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> concluded,
    that there were many Natives thereabouts. He thought it convenient to
    provide Store of dry’d Flesh, for Fear we should not find Game in the
    Country we were going to enter upon, and accordingly caused several
    Beeves to be kill’d for that Purpose.</p>

  <p>For that Reason, we continued there till the 12th, when we went and
    incamped on the Bank of a River, which Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had
    in his former Journey call’d <i>d’Eure</i>. At Night there arose a
    storm, follow’d by Thunder and Rain, which swell’d the Streams, and
    obliged us to stay there. The 13th and 14th we cross’d four or five
    large Rivulets, and then a fine curious Country,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> diversify’d with
    several little Woods, Hills and small Brooks, affording a delightful
    Prospect. That pleasant Country was terminated by a Wood, which we were
    to cross, and were favour’d in it by a Way beaten by the Bullocks, and
    at Night we incamped there.</p>

  <p>The 15th, we travel’d along a fine Meadow, then over <span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>Plains that had
    been burnt, and at Night went to take our Rest on the Bank of a small
    Rivulet, about which we saw several Footsteps of Natives, which made us
    conclude we were not far from them; and therefore we doubled our Guard,
    to prevent being surpriz’d.</p>

  <p>The 16th, Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> left me at the Guard of the
    Camp, and took Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> his Brother, and seven Men
    with him, to go find out the <i>Indians</i>. They had not gone half
    a League before they spied Horses and a Number of Cottages, without
    being themselves seen by the Savages.<span class="sidenote">A Village.</span> That Village stood on the Side
    of a Hill, and contain’d about forty Huts, standing together, besides
    several others straggling.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Monsieur <em>de la Sale</em> well receiv’d by the
    Natives.</span>When Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> enter’d the Village, the Savages seeing
    him, came to meet and conduct him to the Cottage of their Chief, where
    he and his Company were seated on Bullocks Hides. The Elders being
    come, he signify’d to them the Occasion of his Coming, as he had done
    to the other Nations, with which they seem’d to rest satisfy’d. Some
    Presents were made them, according to Custom, and they offer’d him
    a Quantity of Hides, which he refus’d, telling them, that when he
    return’d from the <i>Cenis</i> he would trade with, and furnish them
    with all they had Occasion for. They confirm’d what the others had told
    us, concerning a Nation, where some of them had been, the Men whereof
    were like us, meaning the <i>Spaniards</i>. He nam’d to them the
    Nations we had pass’d through from our Dwelling of St. <i>Lewis</i>,
    to the River <i>Maligne</i>, which we had lately pass’d. The Names of
    those Nations are as follows.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Names of Nations or Tribes.</span>The <i>Spicheats</i>, <i>Kabayes</i>, <i>Thecamons</i>,
    <i>Theauremets</i>, <i>Kiahoba</i>, <i>Choumenes</i>, <i>Kouans</i>,
    <i>Arhan</i>, <i>Enepiahe</i>, <i>Ahonerhopiheim</i>, <i>Korenkake</i>,
    <i>Korkone</i>, <i>Omcaosse</i>, <i>Keremen</i>, <i>Ahehoen</i>,
    <i>Maghai</i>, <i>Thecamenes</i>, <i>Otenmarhem</i>, <i>Kavagan</i> and
    <i>Meracouman</i>. These are the Nations that lay on our Road; those on
    the West and North West of the said River were the <i>Kannehonan</i>,
    <i>Tohaka</i>, <i>Pehir</i>, <i>Coyabegux</i>, <i>Onapien</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
    <i>Pichar</i>, <i>Tohan</i>, <i>Kiasses</i>, <i>Chanzes</i>,
    <i>Tsera</i>, <i>Bocrettes</i>, <i>Tsepehoen</i>, <i>Fercouteha</i>,
    <i>Panego</i>, <i>Petao</i>, <i>Petzares</i>, <i>Peisacho</i>,
    <i>Peihoum</i> and <i>Orcampion</i>.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

  <p>Those we were with then, were call’d <i>Teao</i>, whom we had not
    before hear’d nam’d. They talk’d of a great Nation call’d <i>Ayona</i>
    and <i>Canohatino</i>, who were at War with the <i>Spaniards</i>, from
    whom they stole Horses, and told us, that one hundred <i>Spaniards</i>
    were to have come to join the <i>Cenis</i>, to carry on that War,
    but that having heard of our March, they went back. Monsieur <i>de
    la Sale</i> gave them to understand, that we were at War with the
    <i>Spaniards</i>, and that we fear’d them not; and that he was sent on
    their Account by the great captain of the World, who had charg’d him to
    do them all Good, and to assist them in their Wars against such Nations
    as were their Enemies.</p>

  <p>Those Savages gave Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> Notice, that he would
    find three of our Men among the <i>Cenis</i>, which put him in Hopes
    they were those he had given Leave to depart at his former Journey, and
    of whom he had never since heard. He propos’d to them to barter for
    Horses; but they had caus’d them to be convey’d out of the Way, for
    Fear we should take them away, excepting only one Bay, which Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i> agreed for and return’d to us.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

  <p>The 17th, we pass’d a small River, with some Difficulty, and incamp’d
    beyond it. The 18th, one of our Horses going along the Edge of an
    upright Bank, fell into the Water, and came off with only a Hurt on the
    Shoulder; but we were fain to unload him, and distribute his Burden
    among us, every one making a Pack; and thus we cross’d a curious
    Plain,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> diversify’d with Woods, Hills, Rivulets, and delightful
    Meadows.</p>

  <p>The 19th, we travell’d along the Tops of those Hills, to avoid the
    Bottoms, and found a Difficulty to get down, by reason of the Rocks we
    met with at the End of them, and a River we were to cross. Whilst we
    were passing that River, we heard Dogs hunting the Bullocks, two of
    which coming near us, one of them was shot dead. The Natives who were
    hunting spying us, sent out two of their Number, who creeping from Tree
    to Tree, drew near, and then stood still, without daring to proceed any
    farther. We made Signs to them to come, which they did, and we made
    them smoke, till Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> return’d, being gone a
    little Way to observe the Body of those People.</p>

  <p>When come, he told them, he would entertain Peace with them, that we
    were going to the <i>Cenis</i>, and he believ’d, that these very Men
    were of their Nation, because they had their Accent and some of their
    Words. They told him their Village was near that Place, and bore us
    Company to our Camp, where after some small Presents given them, they
    were dismiss’d.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Account given by a Native.</span>The 20th, Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> sent Monsieur <i>Moranget</i> and
    some others to the Village of those Natives, to try whether they could
    barter with them for some Horses. In the mean Time two Savages came to
    us, one of them being the same that was with us the Night before, and
    they express’d much Friendship for us. That particular <i>Indian</i>
    told us, his name was <i>Palaquechaune</i>, that they were Allies to
    the <i>Cenis</i>, that their Chief had been among the <i>Choumans</i>,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>with the <i>Spaniards</i>; that the <i>Choumans</i> were Friends to
    the <i>Spaniards</i>, from whom they got Horses, and added some farther
    Particulars, which the others had before signify’d to us; so that we
    had good Reason to judge we were not far from <i>North Mexico</i>.</p>

  <p>He also told us, that the <i>Choumans</i> had given their Chief some
    Presents, to perswade him to conduct us to them; that most of the said
    Nation had flat Heads; that they had <i>Indian</i> Corn, which gave
    Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> Ground to believe, that those People were
    some of the same he had seen upon his first Discovery. That same Native
    had a very fine Goat’s Skin, which I purchas’d of him for four Needles,
    after I had shewn him how to use them, and that Skin was of good Use to
    make us Shoes instead of raw Bullocks Hides.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">M. <em>Moranget’s</em> Account.</span>Some Time after, Monsieur <i>Moranget</i> return’d, gave Monsieur <i>de
    la Sale</i> an Account of his short Journey, and said, That one of the
    Natives, who saw us the Night before, came to meet and conduct him to
    the Chief’s Cottage, where forty Ancient<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> <i>Indians</i> were, by
    whom he had been kindly receiv’d. That the Chief had in his Hand a
    Reed, at the end whereof was made fast a Leaf of a <i>French</i> Book,
    which he had an extraordinary Respect for. That they had been made to
    sit on Bullocks Hides, and treated with dry’d Beef.</p>

  <p>That after these first Ceremonies, the Chief had given them to
    understand, that some of their People had been conducted by a Man like
    us, to our Habitation, and that the said Man had promis’d to bring them
    to talk with us, in order to treat of Peace; but that on the Contrary,
    we had fired on them and kill’d one of their Men, which had oblig’d
    them to kill the Man that led them, and that then they return’d. It
    is not improper here to put the Reader in Mind, that I have before
    mention’d this Accident, when the Sieur <i>Barbier</i> crossing the
    River in a Canoe, was call’d upon by some Person, who was among the
    Natives on the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>Bank of the River, who had made two Shots, as it had
    been only the Priming of a Piece, which the Sieur <i>Barbier</i> had
    look’d upon as an Insult, and therefore he had also fir’d, with all the
    other Particulars, as mention’d before; an Accident that happen’d for
    want of understanding one another; which, together with Monsr. <i>de la
    Sale’s</i> forbidding us to have any Communication with the Natives,
    was very prejudicial to us afterwards.</p>

  <p>After much other Discourse, Monsieur <i>Moranget</i> having given
    them some small Presents, they made their return in Bullocks Hides,
    and Goat Skins well dress’d. He ask’d them for some Horses to barter;
    they answer’d, they had no more than what they stood in Need of. We
    immediately proceeded on our Journey, and that day being the 21st, went
    to incamp at the Edge of a Wood.</p>

  <p>The 22d, we went up to an Eminence terminated by a Rock, at the Foot
    whereof ran a little River, the bottom whereof was all of flat Rocks,
    fit for Building.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Thence we descry’d two Natives driving of
    Bullocks, which made us stand upon our Guard, and it appear’d to be our
    <i>Indian</i>, who had met another, with whom he had been acquainted
    among the <i>Cenis</i>, and whom he had brought along with him.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Three lost <em>French</em> Men heard of.</span>Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> was very glad to see him, and remember’d he
    was one of those of whom he had purchas’d a Horse. He ask’d several
    Questions of him, and among the rest, whether he had not seen the
    four Men who deserted in his former Journey, or heard any Talk of
    the others, to whom he had given Leave to return to our Dwelling. He
    answer’d, he had seen one among the <i>Cenis</i>, and two others among
    the <i>Assonis</i>; but that he had not heard of any more, and that
    they must needs be dead; as also the Sieur <i>Bihorel</i>, who was
    likewise mention’d to him.</p>

  <p>He further told us, that there were four or five Cottages thereabouts,
    in which about Fifteen Men resided. At Night <span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>he went away. Our
    <i>Indian</i> had kill’d a Cow at a great Distance and shot her quite
    through, at which the other, who had been an Eye Witness to it, stood a
    long Time amaz’d, without speaking one Word, admiring the Effect of our
    Pieces. That Cow was sent for, and the Flesh brought to our Camp.</p>

  <p>The 23d, we pass’d by the Cottages we had been told of, where the
    Natives were with their Wives and Children. Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i>
    caus’d us to halt in the Village. We were well receiv’d, they presented
    us with dry’d Beef, and we return’d it in some Knives. We saw two
    Horses, one of them a little grey, indifferent handsome. They told us
    they would soon depart that Place, to go join their Companions, who
    were in War with their Enemies. The rest of our Men being come up, we
    went on to incamp a League from thence, on the Bank of a Rivulet, and
    at the Foot of one of the highest Mountains in the Country.</p>

  <p>Unloading our Horses, we perceiv’d there wanted a large Axe, which
    serv’d us for hewing down of Trees. Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> sent
    his <i>Indian</i> to demand it, at the Village we came from last, the
    Savages said they had not seen it, and it was lost. He brought back
    Word, that the Savages had told him, that if we would stay for them,
    they would go along with, and shew us the Way.</p>

  <p>However, we went on the 24th, and incamp’d on the Edge of a Marsh. The
    25th, the Rain hinder’d us from Marching. The 26th, Monsieur <i>de la
    Sale</i> perceiving how difficult and dangerous it was to cross that
    Marsh, sent his <i>Indian</i> to the others, to know whether they
    really design’d to go with us. They answer’d, we must return thither
    to join them. The 27th. we decamp’d, in order to it; but took another
    Way to go meet the <i>Indians</i>. The 28th. we saw them marching at a
    Distance. One of them was detach’d to come tell us, that he would shew
    us the Way to cross the Marsh, and we went on and incamp’d at the Foot
    of the high Mountain I have spoken of.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Mar. 1687</span>The first of <i>March</i>, we join’d the <i>Indians</i>, on the Edge
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span> the Marsh, which we had just cross’d, where the Rains kept us till
    the Fifth, during which Time we went to find out where we might pass
    a rapid Torrent, that discharges it self into the River call’d of
    <i>Canoes</i>, which we pass’d the 6th, in the Canoe we had made, and
    which did us good Service, to pass other Rivers we met with the 7th and
    the 8th on our Way.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">River of Canoes.</span>The 9th, we did not stir, because of the Rain. The 10th, incamp’d on
    the Bank of a small River, which we cross’d the 11th, and the same Day
    another River, and incamp’d on the Bank of it, and found it adorn’d
    with very fine Mulberry Trees. The 12th we cross’d another River, and
    incamp’d near it. The 13th, came again to the River of <i>Canoes</i>,
    so called by Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, because he the first Time
    put Canoes into it, at his former Journey. We pass’d it the 14th, and
    incamp’d on the other Side where we again join’d the <i>Indians</i>.</p>

  <p>The 15th, we held on our Journey with them, and found a pleasanter
    Country than that we had pass’d thro’; and Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>
    having in his former Journey hid some Indian Wheat and Beans,<span class="sidenote">Provisions hid, spoilt.</span> two or
    three Leagues from that Place, and our Provisions beginning to fall
    short, it was thought fit to go to that Place. Accordingly he order’d
    the Sieurs <i>Duhaut</i>, <i>Hiens</i>, <i>Liotot</i> the Surgeon, his
    own <i>Indian</i>, and his Footman, whose Name was <i>Saget</i>, who
    were followed by some Natives, to go to the Place he described to them,
    where they found all rotten and quite spoilt.</p>

  <p>The 16, in their Return, they met with two Bullocks, which Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale’s</i> <i>Indian</i> kill’d, whereupon they sent back his
    Footman, to give him Notice of what they had kill’d, that if he would
    have the Flesh dry’d, he might send Horses for it. The 17th, Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i> had the Horses taken up, and order’d the Sieurs
    <i>Moranget</i> and <i>de Malre</i> and his Footman, to go for that
    Meat, and send back a Horse Load immediately, till the rest was dry’d.</p>

  <p>Monsieur <i>Moranget</i>, when he came thither, found they had smoak’d
    both the Beeves, tho’ they were not dry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span> enough; and the said Sieurs
    <i>Liotot</i>, <i>Hiens</i>, <i>Duhaut</i> and the rest had laid aside
    the Marrow-Bones and others to roast them, and eat the flesh that
    remain’d on them, as was usual to do. The Sieur <i>Moranget</i><span class="sidenote">Discontent occasion’d by Monsr. <em>Moranget</em>.</span> found
    fault with it, he in a Passion seiz’d not only the Flesh that was
    smoak’d and dry’d, but also the Bones, without giving them any Thing;
    but on the contrary, threat’ning they should not eat so much of it, as
    they had imagin’d, and that he would manage that Flesh after another Manner.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Conspiracy to murder Monsr. <em>de la Sale</em>.</span>This passionate Behaviour, so much out of Season, and contrary to
    Reason and Custom, touch’d the Surgeon <i>Liotot</i>, <i>Hiens</i>
    and <i>Duhaut</i> to the Quick, they having other Causes of Complaint
    against <i>Moranget</i>. They withdrew, and resolv’d together upon a
    bloody Revenge; they agreed upon the Manner of it, and concluded they
    would murder the Sieur <i>Moranget</i>, Monsieur <i>de la Sale’s</i>
    Footman and his <i>Indian</i>, because he was very faithful to him.</p>

  <p>They waited till Night, when those unfortunate Creatures had supp’d and
    were asleep. <i>Liotot</i> the Surgeon was the inhuman Executioner, he
    took an Ax, began by the Sieur <i>Moranget</i>,<span class="sidenote">Bloody Murderers.</span> giving him many Strokes
    on the Head; the same he did by the Footman and the <i>Indian</i>,
    killing them on the Spot, whilst his Fellow Villains, <i>viz.</i>
    <i>Duhaut</i>, <i>Hiens</i>, <i>Teissier</i> and <i>Larcheveque</i>
    stood upon their Guard, with their Arms, to fire upon such as should
    make any Resistance. The <i>Indian</i> and the Footman never stir’d,
    but the Sieur <i>Moranget</i> had so much Vigour as to sit up, but
    without being able to speak one Word, and the Assasins obliged the
    Sieur <i>de Marle</i> to make an End of him, tho’ he was not in the
    Conspiracy.</p>

  <p>This Slaughter had yet satisfy’d but one Part of the Revenge of
    those Murderers. To finish it and secure themselves it was requisite
    to destroy the Commander in Chief. They consulted<span class="sidenote">Consult to murder Monsr. <em>de la Sale</em>.</span> about the safest
    Method to effect it, and resolved to go together to Monsieur <i>de la
    Sale</i>, to knock out the Brains of the most resolute immediately, and
    then it would be easier to overcome the rest. But the River,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span> which
    was between them and us, being much swollen, the Difficulty of passing
    it made them put it off the 18th and 19th. On the other Hand Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i> was very uneasy, on Account of their long Stay. His
    Impatience made him resolve to go himself to find out his People and to
    know the Cause of it.</p>

  <p>This was not done without many previous Tokens of Concern, and
    Apprehension. He seem’d to have some Presage of his Misfortune,
    enquiring of some, whether the Sieur <i>Liotot</i>, <i>Hiens</i> and
    <i>Duhaut</i> had not express’d some Discontent; and not hearing any
    Thing of it, he could not forbear setting out the 20th,<span class="sidenote">He goes to seek them.</span> with Father
    <i>Anastasius</i> and an <i>Indian</i>, leaving me the Command in his
    Absence, and charging me from Time to Time to go the Rounds about
    our Camp, to prevent being surpriz’d, and to make a Smoke for him to
    direct his Way in Case of Need. When he came near the Dwelling of the
    Murderers, looking out sharp to discover something, he observed Eagles
    fluttering about a Spot, not far from them, which made him believe they
    had found some Carrion about the Mansion, and he fired a Shot, which
    was the signal of his Death and forwarded it.</p>

  <p>The Conspirators hearing the Shot, concluded it was Monsieur <i>de
    la Sale</i>, who was come to seek them. They made ready their Arms
    and provided to surprize him. <i>Duhaut</i> passed the River, with
    <i>Larcheveque</i>. The first of them spying Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>
    at a Distance, as he was coming towards them, advanc’d and hid himself
    among the high Weeds, to wait his passing by, so that Monsieur <i>de
    la Sale</i> suspecting nothing, and having not so much as charg’d his
    Piece again, saw the aforesaid <i>Larcheveque</i> at a good Distance
    from him, and immediately ask’d for his Nephew <i>Moranget</i>, to
    which <i>Larcheveque</i> answer’d, That he was along the River.<span class="sidenote">Is murder’d.</span> At the
    same Time the Traitor <i>Duhaut</i> fired his Piece and shot Monsr.
    <i>de la Sale</i> thro’ the Head, so that he dropp’d down dead on the
    Spot, without speaking one Word.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

  <p>Father <i>Anastasius</i>, who was then by his Side, stood stock still
    in a Fright, expecting the same Fate, and not knowing whether he should
    go forwards or backwards; but the Murderer <i>Duhaut</i> put him out
    of that Dread, bidding him not to fear, for no Hurt was intended him;
    that it was Despair that had prevail’d with him to do what he saw;
    that he had long desir’d to be revenged on <i>Moranget</i>, because he
    had designed to ruin him, and that he was partly the Occasion of his
    Uncle’s Death. This is the exact Relation of that Murder, as it was
    presently after told me by F. <i>Anastasius</i>.</p>

  <p>Such was the unfortunate End of Monsieur <i>de la Sale’s</i> Life, at
    a Time when he might entertain the greatest Hopes, as the Reward of
    his Labours.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
    <span class="sidenote">His Character.</span>He had a Capacity and Talent to make his Enterprize
    successful; his Constancy and Courage and his extraordinary Knowledge
    in Arts and Sciences, which render’d him fit for any Thing, together
    with an indefatigable Body, which made him surmount all Difficulties,
    would have procur’d a glorious Issue to his Undertaking, had not
    all those excellent Qualities been counterbalanced by too haughty a
    Behaviour, which sometimes made him insupportable, and by a Rigidness
    towards those that were under his Command, which at last drew on him an
    implacable Hatred, and was the Occasion of his Death.</p>

  <p>The Shot which had kill’d Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, was also a Signal
    of the Murder to the Assassins for them to draw near. They all repair’d
    to the Place where the wretched dead Corps lay, which they barbarously
    strip’d to the Shirt, and vented their Malice<span class="sidenote">Barbarity towards the dead Body.</span> in vile and opprobrious
    Language. The Surgeon <i>Liotot</i> said several Times in Scorn and
    Derision, <i>There thou liest, Great Bassa, there thou liest.</i> In
    Conclusion, they dragged it naked among the Bushes, and left it exposed
    to the ravenous Wild Beasts. So far was it <span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>from what a certain Author
    writes, of their having bury’d him and set up a cross on his Grave.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Murderers return to the Camp.</span>When those Murderers had satiated their Rage, they set out to come
    to us at our Camp, with the dry’d Flesh, which they had caus’d to be
    brought over the River by the <i>Indians</i>, who had been Spectators
    of the Murder and of all the inhuman Actions that had been committed,
    with Amazement and Contempt of us. When they were come to the Camp,
    they found Messieurs <i>Cavelier</i>, the one Brother, the other Nephew
    to the murder’d Commander, whom Father <i>Anastasius</i> acquainted
    with the dismal End of our Chief, and enjoyn’d them Silence, which
    it is easy to imagine was very hard upon them; but it was absolutely
    necessary.</p>

  <p>However, Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> the Priest, could not forbear telling
    them, that if they would do the same by him, he would forgive them
    his Murder, and only desir’d them to give him a Quarter of an Hour to
    prepare himself: They answer’d, They had Nothing to say to him; that
    what they had done was the Effect of Despair, to be reveng’d for the
    ill Usage they had receiv’d.</p>

  <p>I was absent at that Time; he they call’d <i>Larcheveque</i>, who, as I
    have said, was one of the Conspirators, had some Kindness for me, and
    knowing they design’d to make me away too, if I stood upon my Defence,
    he parted from them, to give me Notice of their Mischievous Resolution.
    He found me on a little rising Ground, where I was looking upon our
    Horses as they graz’d in a little adjacent Bottom. His Intelligence
    struck me to the Heart, not knowing whether I should fly or stay; but
    at length, having neither Powder nor Shot,<span class="sidenote">The Author sav’d by a Friend.</span> nor Arms, and the said
    <i>Larcheveque</i> giving me Assurances of my Life, provided I was
    quiet and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>said Nothing,
    I committed my self to God’s Protection, and
    went to them, without taking any Notice of what had been done.</p>

  <p><i>Duhaut</i>,<span class="sidenote"><em>Duhaut</em>, the Murderer, usurps the Command.</span> puff’d up with his new gotten Authority, procur’d him
    by his Villany, as soon as he saw me, cry’d out, Every Man ought to
    command in his Turn; to which I made no Answer; and we were all of us
    oblig’d to stifle our Resentment, that it might not appear, for our
    Lives depended on it. However, it was easy to judge with what Eyes
    Father <i>Anastasius</i>, Messieurs <i>Cavelier</i> and I beheld these
    Murderers, to whom we expected every Moment to fall Sacrifices. It is
    true, we dissembled so well, that they were not very suspicious of us,
    and that the Temptation we were under of making them away in Revenge
    for those they had murder’d, would have easily prevail’d and been put
    in Execution, had not Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i>, the Priest, always
    positively oppos’d it, alledging, that we ought to leave Vengeance to God.</p>

  <p>However the Murderers seiz’d upon all the Effects, without any
    Opposition,<span class="sidenote">March continued.</span> and then we began to talk of proceeding on our Journey.
    We decamp’d the 21st, with our <i>Indians</i>, and march’d with such
    a heavy Rain, that we were oblig’d to halt on the Bank of a great
    Stream, where one of the Natives that had left us, arriv’d with his
    Wife. We went on the 22d and 23d, and pass’d the River, where Father
    <i>Anastasius</i>, Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> and I, who could not swim,
    had been drown’d, but that the Natives assisted and sav’d us. The 24th,
    we went on thro’ a marshy Country, never quitting a small Path which
    led to the Village of the <i>Cenis</i>, till the 28th, when we rested
    on the Bank of a River of the same Name,<span class="sidenote"><em>Cenis</em> River.</span> tho’ about ten Leagues distant
    from the Village.</p>

  <p>We had hop’d to ford that River, as Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had
    done, when he return’d from that Country; but it was so swollen, that
    there was no doing it, and we were forced to make a Canoe of Bullocks
    Hides. Whilst we were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span> employ’d at that Work, the <i>Indians</i> swam
    over and went to give Notice to the <i>Cenis</i> of our Arrival.</p>

  <p>We found the Country pleasant enough about that River, tho’ the Land
    did not seem to be any of the best; but still it was delightful to
    the Eye, well planted with fine Trees of several Sorts, among which,
    is one that Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had nam’d <i>Copal</i>,<span class="sidenote"><em>Copal</em> Tree.</span> being
    very beautiful, the Leaves of it between those of the Maple and the
    lime<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Trees in Resemblance, and from it comes a Gum, of a very
    agreeable Scent. In the same Place we saw a great Tree, on which the
    late Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had caus’d Crosses and the Arms of
    <i>France</i> to be carv’d.</p>

  <p>The Hunting of Bullocks had fail’d us, and we had seen none from the
    Place where our late Leader had been murder’d. Thus our Provisions
    began to fall short, and it was resolv’d on the 29th, to send some
    Men before, to the Village of the <i>Cenis</i>, to know, whether they
    had any <i>Indian</i> Corn, and were willing to barter for it.
    <span class="sidenote">The Author sent to the <em>Cenis</em> for Provisions.</span> I was
    appointed, with the Surgeon <i>Liotot</i>, the <i>Teisieers</i>, and
    <i>Hiens</i>, who was a Buccanier, Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had taken
    up at <i>Petit Gouave</i>, to go with him upon this Expedition. I was
    very unwilling to undertake that Journey, with a Murderer and two of
    his Companions, of whom I was suspicious; but it was very requisite
    to obey, and <i>Duhaut</i> having all the Effects in his Possession,
    alledging, that a great part of them belong’d to him, he gave us some
    Axes and Knives to barter for <i>Indian</i> Corn, as also for Horses,
    if any were to be had, and accordingly we pass’d the River.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">The Country describ’d.</span>We found the Country made up of several little Hills, of an indifferent
    Height, on which there are Abundance of Wallnut-Trees and Oaks, not so
    large as what we had seen before, but very agreeable. The Weeds which
    had been some Time before burnt by the Natives, began to spring up
    again, and discover’d large green Fields very pleasing to the Sight.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>

  <p>When we had travell’d some Time, we discover’d three Men a Horseback,
    coming towards us from the Village, and being come near them, saw one
    dress’d after the <i>Spanish</i><span class="sidenote">A Man clad like a Spaniard.</span> Fashion, with a little Doublet, the
    Body whereof was of blue, and the Sleeves of white Fustian, as it were
    imbroider’d, with very streight Breeches, white worsted Stockings,
    Woollen-Garters, a broad-brim’d, flat-crown’d Hat, and long Hair. We
    presently concluded he was a <i>Spaniard</i>, and the rather because we
    had been told, that some of them were to come to join in League with
    the <i>Cenis</i>, against an Enemy nation, and we were at a Nonplus;
    for if we fell into their Hands, we must never expect to get away, but
    be condemn’d to serve either in the Mines, or in the Quarries, in the
    Kingdom of <i>Mexico</i>, for which Reason we provided to give the
    pretended <i>Spaniard</i> an unkind Reception, and then to make the
    best of our Way back.</p>

  <p>Being come up to him, I spoke some Words of <i>Spanish</i> and
    <i>Italian</i>, to which he return’d no Answer; but on the contrary,
    made use of the Word <em>Coussica</em>, which in the Language of the
    <i>Cenis</i>, signifies, <em>I do not understand you</em>; which Answer
    of his remov’d our Apprehensions. The two others were quite naked, one
    of them being mounted on a fine grey Mare, and on her were besides two
    Panniers, handsomely made of Reeds, full of very fine Meal parch’d, or
    roasted. After several Questions, to which we had no very satisfactory
    Answers, we lighted Fire to make them smoke, and then they presented us
    with the two Panniers full of Meal, giving us to understand, that their
    Chief expected us in the Village, and having signify’d, that they were
    sent to meet us, we gave them some Knives and Strings of Beads.</p>

  <p>We ask’d them, whether they had any Men among them like him that was
    a Horseback in the <i>Spanish</i> Habit, they answer’d, there were
    two in a Neighboring Nation, call’d <i>Assony</i>, and that he who
    was clad, had been in their Country, and brought thence the Cloaths
    we saw him wear. That Man then shew’d us a <i>Spanish</i> printed
    Paper, containing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span> the Indulgences granted to the Missioners of <i>New
    Mexico</i>. After this they left us to go on, to our People, for which
    Reason I writ a Note, giving an Account of our having met them.</p>

  <p>We alighted to eat, and let our Horses graze on the Bank of a Rivulet;
    but it was not long before the same Natives, who had been with us
    before, appear’d again hard by us. We made Signs to them to draw near
    and eat with us; which they did, and then went along with us towards
    the Village, which we would not go into, because it was Night. The
    <i>Indian</i> that was clad, stay’d all Night with us, and the two
    others went away.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">The <em>Cenis</em> meet the French in solemn Manner.</span>When it was Day, we held on our Way to the Village; the <i>Indian</i>
    that was with us conducting us to their Chief’s Cottage. By the Way,
    we saw many other Cottages, and the Elders coming to meet us in their
    Formalities,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> which consisted in some Goats Skins dress’d and
    painted of several Colours, which they wore on their Shoulders like
    Belts, and Plumes of Feathers of several Colours, on their Heads,
    like Coronets. Six or seven of them had square Sword Blades, like the
    <i>Spanish</i>, on the Hilts whereof they had fasten’d great Plumes of
    Feathers, and several Hawks Bells; some of them had Clubs, which they
    call Headbreakers, some only their Bows and Arrows;<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> others, Bits of
    White Linen, reaching from Shoulder to Shoulder. All their Faces were
    daub’d with black or red. There were twelve Elders, who walk’d in the
    Middle, and the Youth and Warriors in Ranks, on the Sides of those old Men.</p>

  <p>Being come up to us in that Manner, he that conducted us, made a Sign
    for us to halt, which when we had done, all the old Men lifted up their
    Right Hands above their Heads, crying out in a most ridiculous Manner;
    but it behov’d us to have a Care of laughing. That done, they <span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>came and
    imbrac’d us, using all Sorts of Endearments. Then they made us smoke,
    and brought to us a French Man<span class="sidenote">A French Man among the Indians.</span> of <i>Provence</i>, who was one of those
    that had forsaken the late Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, at his first
    Journey.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

  <p>The whole Company conducted us after the same Manner, to their Chief’s
    Cottage; and after we had staid there a short Time, they led us to a
    larger Cottage, a Quarter of a League from thence, being the Hut in
    which they have their publick Rejoycings, and the great Assemblies.
    <span class="sidenote">Indian Entertainment.</span>
    We found it furnish’d with Mats for us to sit on. The Elders
    seated themselves round about us, and they brought us to eat, some
    <i>Sagamite</i>, which is their Pottage, little Beans, Bread made of
    <i>Indian</i> Corn, and another Sort they make with boil’d Flower, and
    at last they made us smoke.</p>

  <p>During our Repast, they entertain’d us with the Discourse of their
    Design to make War on a Nation, who were their Enemies, and whom they
    call’d <i>Cannohantimo</i>. When it was over, we presented them,
    according to Custom, with some Knives and Strings of Beads for their
    Wives. We desir’d them to afford us some <i>Indian</i> Corn, in
    Exchange for other Things, which they promis’d, and the French Man
    who was with them, having told us, that there was a District, which
    afforded more Corn, than that where we were, and where his Cottage was,
    we resolv’d to go thither. We propos’d it to the Elders, who would
    needs go along with us, attended by a great Number of Youth, and having
    got ready our Horses, we set out for that Place.</p>

  <p>By the Way, we saw several Cottages at certain Distances, straggling up
    and down,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> as the Ground happens to be fit for Tillage. The Field
    lies about the Cottage, and at other Distances,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> there are other
    large Huts, not inhabited, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>but only serving for publick Assemblies,
    either upon Occasion of Rejoycings, or to consult about Peace and War.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Huts and Families in them.</span>
    The Cottages that are inhabited, are not each of them for a private
    Family, for in some of them there are fifteen or twenty, each of which
    has its Nook or Corner, Bed and other Utensils to its self; but without
    any Partition to separate it from the rest: However, they have Nothing
    in Common besides the Fire, which is in the Midst of the Hut, and
    never goes out. It is made of great Trees, the Ends whereof are laid
    together, so that when once lighted, it lasts a long Time, and the
    first Comer takes Care to keep it up.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Manner of Building.</span>
    The Cottages are round at the Top, after the Manner of a Bee-Hive, or
    a Reek of Hay. Some of them are sixty Foot Diameter. In Order to build
    them, they plant Trees as thick as a Man’s Thigh, tall and strait,
    and placing them in a Circle, and joyning the Tops together, form the
    Dome, or round Top, then they lath and cover them with Weeds. When they
    remove their Dwellings, they generally burn the Cottages they leave,
    and build new on the Ground they design to inhabit.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Their moveables.</span>Their Moveables are some Bullocks Hides and Goats Skins well cur’d, some
    Mats close wove, wherewith they adorn their Huts, and some Earthen
    Vessels, which they are very skilful at making, and wherein they boil
    their Flesh or Roots, or <i>Sagamite</i>, which, as has been said, is
    their Pottage. They have also some small Baskets made of Canes, serving
    to put in their Fruit and other Provisions.<span class="sidenote">Beds.</span> Their Beds are made of
    Canes, rais’d two or three Foot above the Ground, handsomely fitted
    with Mats and Bullocks Hides, or Goats Skins well cur’d, which serve
    them for Feather Beds, or Quilts and Blankets cured with the hair on,
    to serve as mattresses and bedclothes; and those Beds are parted one
    from another by Mats hung up.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Tillage.</span>When they design to Till the Ground, they give one another Notice, and
    very often above an Hundred of each Sex meet together. When they have
    till’d that Piece of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span> Land, after their Manner, and spent part of the
    Day, those the Land belongs to, give the others to Eat, and then they
    spend the rest of the Day in Dancing and Merry Making. This same is
    practis’d from Canton to Canton, and so they till Land all together.</p>

  <p>This Tillage consists in breaking up just the Surface of the Earth with
    a Sort of Wooden Instrument,<span class="sidenote">Instrument for Tilling.</span> like a little Pick-axe, which they make by
    splitting the End of a thick Piece of Wood, that serves for a Handle,
    and putting another Piece of Wood sharp Pointed at one End into the
    Slit. This Instrument serves them instead of a Hoe, or Spade, for they
    have no Iron Tools. When the Land has been thus till’d or broke up,
    the Women Sow<span class="sidenote">Women sow.</span> and Plant the <i>Indian</i> Corn, Beans, Pompions, Water
    Melons, and other Grain and Garden Ware, which is for their Sustenance.</p>

  <p>The <i>Indians</i> are generally Handsom,<span class="sidenote"><em>Indians</em> disfigure themselves.</span> but disfigure themselves by
    making Scores, or Streaks on their Faces, from the Top of the Forehead
    down the Nose to the Tip of the Chin; which is done by pricking the
    Skin with Needles, or other sharp Instruments, till it bleeds, whereon
    they strew fine Powder of Charcoal, and that sinks in and mixes with
    the Blood within the Skin. They also make after the same Manner, the
    Figures of living Creatures, of Leaves and Flowers on their Shoulders,
    Thighs, and other Parts of their Bodies, and Paint themselves, as has
    been said before, with Black or Red, and sometimes both together.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Women.</span>The Women are generally well Shap’d, and would not be disagreeable, did
    they adhere to Nature; but they Disguise themselves as ridiculously as
    the Men, not only with the Streak they have like them down their Face,
    but by other Figures they make on it, at the Corners of their Eyes, and
    on the other Parts of their Bodies; whereof they make more particular
    Show on their Bosom, and those who have the most, are reckoned the
    handsomest; tho’ that pricking in that Part be extremely painful to them.</p>

  <p>It is they that do all the Work<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> in the Cottage, either in
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>Pounding the <i>Indian</i> Corn and Baking
    the Meal,<span class="sidenote">They do the Work at Home.</span> or making the
    Pottage of the said Meal, by them call’d <i>Sagamite</i>, or in
    dressing their other Provisions, or drying or parching, or smoaking
    their Flesh, fetching the Wood they have Occasion for, or the Flesh of
    Bullocks, or other Beasts kill’d by their Husbands in the Woods, which
    are often at a great Distance, and afterwards Dressing them as has
    been said. They Sow and Plant, when the Land has been broke up, and in
    short, do almost all that is requisite for the Support of Life.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Their Behaviour.</span>I did not observe that those Women were naturally given to Lewdness;
    but their Virtue is not Proof against some of our Toys, when presented
    them, as Needles, Knives, and more particularly Strings of Beads,
    whereof they make Necklaces and Bracelets, and that Temptation is
    rarely resisted by them, and the less because they have no Religion
    or Law to prohibit that vile Practice. It is true their Husbands,
    when they take them in the Fact, sometimes do punish them, either by
    Separation or otherwise; but that is rare.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Habits.</span>The Country of those <i>Indians</i> being generally subject to no Cold,
    almost all of them go naked; unless when the <i>North</i> Wind blows,
    then they cover themselves with a Bullock’s Hide, or Goat’s Skin cur’d.
    The Women wear nothing but a Skin, Mat, or Clout, hanging round them
    like a Petticoat, and reaching down half way their Legs, which hides
    their Nakedness before and behind. On their Heads they have nothing but
    their Hair platted and knotted behind.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Manners.</span>As for their Manners, it may be said of these as of all other
    <i>Indians</i> of that great Continent, that they are not Mischievous,
    unless wrong’d or attack’d; in which Case they are all Fierce and
    Revengeful. They Watch all Opportunities to be Reveng’d, and never let
    any slip, when offer’d, which is the Cause of their being continually
    at War with their Neighbours, and of that Martial Humour, so
    Predominant among them.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Religion.</span>As to the Knowledge of a God, they did not seem to us to have any fix’d
    Notion of Him; it is true, we met with some on our Way, who as far as
    we could judge, believ’d, there was some Superior Being, which was
    above all Things, and this they testify’d by lifting up their Hands and
    Eyes to Heaven, yet without any Manner of Concern, as believing that
    the said exalted Being does not regard at all, what is done here below.
    However none of them having any Places of Worship, Ceremonies, or
    Prayers, to denote the divine Homage, it may be said of them all, that
    they have no Religion, at least those that we saw.</p>

  <p>However, they observe some Ceremonies;<span class="sidenote">Ceremonies.</span> but whether they have any
    Regard to a real or pretended Superior Being, or whether they are
    only popular, and proceeding from Custom, is what we were not able to
    discover. Those Ceremonies are as follows. When the Corn is ripe, they
    gather a certain Quantity in a Maund or Basket, which is placed on a
    Sort of Seat or Stool, dedicated to that Use, and serving only upon
    those misterious Occasions, which they have a great Veneration for.</p>

  <p>The Basket with the Corn being placed on that honour’d Stool, one of
    the Elders holds out his Hands over it, and talks a long Time; after
    which, the said old Man distributes the Corn among the Women, and no
    Person is allow’d to eat of the new Corn, till eight Days after that
    Ceremony. This seems to be in the Nature of Offering up or Blessing the
    first Fruits of their Harvest.</p>

  <p>At their Assemblies, when the <i>Sagamite</i>, or Pottage, which is
    the most essential Part of their meal, is boil’d in a great Pot, they
    place that Pot on the Stool of Ceremony above mention’d, and one of the
    Elders stretches out his Hands over it, muttering some Words between
    his Teeth for a considerable Time, after which, they fall to eat.</p>

  <p>When the young Folks are grown up to be fit to go to the Wars, and
    take upon them to be Soldiers, their Garment, consisting of some Skin,
    or Clout, together with their Bow, Quiver and Arrows, is placed on
    the aforesaid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span> Stool, an old Man stretches out his Hands over them,
    mutters the Words as above, and then the Garments, Bows, Quivers, and
    Arrows are given to the Persons they belong to. This may be compar’d to
    Something of a Ceremony of Knighting among them. The same Ceremonies
    are us’d by them in the cultivating of their Grain and Product, but
    particularly of the Tabacco,<span class="sidenote">Tabacco.</span> whereof they have a Sort, which has
    smaller Leaves than Ours; it is almost ever green and they use it in Leaves.</p>

  <p>This is what we observ’d among the <i>Cenis</i>, whose Customs and
    Manners differ very little from those of other Nations, which we had
    seen before, and saw afterwards. As to the Point of Religion, it is
    not to be infer’d from what I have said above, that there is none
    throughout that vast Continent: The Account I have given only regards
    those Nations we saw; there may be others that have some Worship, and I
    remember I have heard Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> say, that the Nation
    call’d <i>Takensa</i>, neighbouring on the <i>Islinois</i>, ador’d the
    Fire, and that they had Cottages which they made use of, as Temples.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Nation, what is meant here by it.</span>Before I conclude this short Account of the Religion, Customs and
    Manners of the <i>Cenis</i>, which belong’d properly to this Place,
    it is fit here also to observe, that the Word Nation, is not to be
    understood, among those <i>Indians</i>, to denote a People possessing a
    whole Province, or vast Extent of Land. Those Nations are no other than
    a Parcel of Villages, dispers’d for the Space of fifteen, of twenty or
    of thirty Leagues at most, which compose a distinct People or Nation;
    and they differ from one another rather in Language than in Manners,
    wherein they are all much alike, or at least they vary but little, as
    has been mention’d above. As for the Names of them, here follow those
    of such as we travel’d through, or were near the Way we held from our
    leaving our Habitation near the Bay of the Holy Ghost, till we came
    among the <i>Cenis</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Names of Nations.</span>The <i>Spicheats</i>, <i>Kabayes</i>, <i>Thecamons</i>,

    <i>Ahekouen</i>, <i>Meghty</i>, <i>Tetamenes</i>, <i>Otenmarhem</i>,
    <i>Kouayon</i> and <i>Meracouman</i>. All these Nations are on the
    North of the River called <i>la Maligne</i>. Those that follow, are on
    the West and North-West of the same River.</p>

    This last Nation borders upon the <i>Cenis</i>, at the Entrance into
    whose first Village I left my Reader, to give an Account of the
    Inhabitants, and thither I return, to proceed with my Relation and
    our Journey to the Village, the <i>French</i> Man who liv’d among the
    Natives was to conduct us to.</p>

  <p>We arriv’d there at Night, and found other Elders coming out to meet
    us, much after the same Manner as the others mention’d before. They led
    us to their Cottage, made us sit down on Mats and smoke, but not with
    so much Ceremony as the others. That done, it was Time for us to take
    our Rest, having given them to understand that we were weary.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote"><em>French</em> Entertained by the Natives.</span>The <i>French Provencal</i> would needs have us go to his Cottage, that
    is to the Hut where he had his Dwelling; for, as I have said, there are
    several Families in one of them, and that was one of the greatest in
    the Canton, having been the Habitation of one of their Chief’s, lately
    deceased.</p>

  <p>They allotted us a Place there, for our Goods and Packs, the Women
    immediately made <i>Sagamite</i> or Pottage, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>gave it us. Having
    eaten, we ask’d the <i>French</i> Man whether we were safe, and he
    answering we were, we lay down, but yet could not sleep sound.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Apr. 1687</span>The next Day, being the first of <i>April</i>, the Elders came to
    receive and conducted us to the Cottage where we had been the Day
    before. After the usual Ceremonies, we traded with them for Corn, Meal
    and Beans, giving in Exchange for the same, Needles, Knives, Rings and
    other Toys. We also purchased a very fine Stone Horse,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104"
    class="fnanchor">[104]</a><span class="sidenote">A Horse sold for an Ax.</span> that would
    have been worth twenty Pistoles in <i>France</i>, for an Ax.</p>

  <p>The Day was spent in driving our small Bargains and gathering
    Provisions, which the Women brought. When that was done, it was agreed,
    that I should remain there, to lay up more Store, and that the others
    should return to our Company, which we had left near the River, to
    carry the Provisions and satisfy them they might come safely.</p>

  <p>Tho’ I thought my self not over secure among the <i>Indians</i>,
    and besides had the Dissatisfaction of understanding none of their
    Language; yet was I not unwilling to stay, that I might have an
    Opportunity of seeing the two other <i>French</i> Men, who had forsaken
    the late Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, when he first travell’d into
    that Country, that I might enquire of them, whether they had heard no
    talk of the <i>Missisipi</i> River, for I still held my Resolution of
    parting from our wicked Murderers.</p>

  <p>As soon as they were gone, I gave a young <i>Indian</i> a Knife, to
    go bid those two other <i>French</i> Men come to me, and whilst he
    was going I drove on my little Trade for Provisions, and had frequent
    Visits from the Elders, who entertain’d me by Signs, with an Account of
    their intended War; to which I still answer’d, nodding my Head, tho’
    very often I knew not what they meant. It was some Difficulty to me to
    secure my small Merchandize, especially at Night, for the Natives were
    covetous of them.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

  <p>This Care, which kept me from Sleeping sound, was the Occasion, that
    one Night I heard some Body moving near my Bed, and opening my Eyes,
    by the Light of the Fire, which never goes out in those Cottages,
    perceiv’d a Man stark naked,<span class="sidenote">The Author meets another French Man among the
    Indians.</span> with a Bow and two Arrows in his Hand,
    who came and sat down by me, without saying any Thing. I view’d him
    for some Time, I spoke to him, he made me no Answer, and not knowing
    what to think of it, I laid hold of my two Pistols and my Firelock,
    which the Man perceiving, he went and sat by the Fire. I follow’d, and
    looking steadfastly on him, he knew and spoke to me, throwing his Arms
    about and embracing me, and then made himself known to be one of the
    French Men I had sent for.</p>

  <p>We fell into Discourse, I ask’d him for his Comrade, he told me, he
    durst not come, for Fear of Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>. They were both
    Sailors, this Man, who was of <i>Britany</i>, was call’d <i>Ruter</i>;
    the other, of <i>Rochelle</i>, <i>Grollet</i>. They had, in that short
    Space of Time, so perfectly enur’d themselves to the Customs of the
    Natives, that they were become meer Savages.<span class="sidenote">French turn’d savage.</span> They were naked, their
    Faces and Bodies with Figures wrought on them, like the rest. They
    had taken several Wives, been at the Wars and kill’d their Enemies
    with their Firelocks, which had gain’d them Reputation; but having no
    more Powder nor Ball, their Arms were grown useless, and they had been
    forc’d to learn to shoot with Bows and Arrows. As for Religion, they
    were not troubled with much of it, and that Libertine Life they led,
    was pleasing to them.</p>

  <p>I acquainted this Man with the unfortunate Death of Monsr. <i>de la
    Sale</i>, his Nephew and the rest, at which, he was surpris’d and
    concern’d, at least in outward Appearance. I ask’d him, whether he had
    not heard talk of the <i>Missisipi</i>; he told me he had not; but
    only that there was a great River forty Leagues from thence towards
    the <i>N. W.</i><a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>where the Natives said there were many Nations
    along its Banks. That made me believe, it was the very River we were in
    Search of, or at least that it must be the Way to come at it. I gave
    him to eat, and we went to Rest.</p>

  <p>The next and the following Days, I continu’d trading, and the Elders
    their Visits, and their Discourse by Signs, concerning their intended
    War. Some of them gave me to understand, that they had been among the
    <i>Spaniards</i>, who are nevertheless about two hundred Leagues from
    them. They spoke some Words of broken <i>Spanish</i>, as <i>Capita</i>,
    instead of <i>Capitan</i>, a Captain, and <i>Cohavillo</i> instead
    of <i>Cavallo</i>, a Horse, and so of some others. <i>Ruter</i>, the
    <i>French</i> Man return’d to his Dwelling, I gave him some Strings of
    Beads for his Wives, and desir’d him to send the other <i>French</i>
    Man to me.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Indian Maid brought to the Author.</span>
    In the mean Time my being alone, as to any Person I could converse
    with, grew very irksome to me, and I know not whether an old Man
    did not perceive it; for he thought it would be proper to bring a
    Companion, to divert me, and at Night I was surpris’d to see a young
    Maid come sit down by me, and to hear the old Man tell me, he had
    brought her to be my Wife, and gave her to me; but I had far different
    Thoughts to disturb me. I spoke not one Word to that poor Maid; she
    stay’d some Time expecting I would take notice of her, and perceiving I
    did not stir, or speak one Word, she withdrew.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote"><em>French</em> Men like <em>Indians</em>.</span>Thus I continu’d, without hearing any News, till the Sixth of
    <i>April</i>, when the two <i>French</i> Men, I have spoken of, came
    both, in the <i>Indian</i> Dress, each of them having only a Clout
    about him, some Turky Feathers on their Shoulders, their Heads and
    Feet bare. The latter of them whose name was <i>Grollet</i>, had not
    consented to have his Face mark’d like the other, nor to cut his Hair
    after the <i>Indian</i> Manner; for those People cut off all theirs,
    except a small Lock on the Crown of the Head, like the Turks, only some
    of them have small Tresses on the Temples.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

  <p>I repeated to them the Narrative of Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>’s
    unfortunate Story. They confirm’d what I had been told before, that the
    Natives had talk’d to them of the great River, which was forty Leagues
    off, towards the N. E. and that there were People like us, that dwelt
    on the Banks of it. This confirm’d me in the Opinion, that it was the
    River so much sought after, and that we must go that Way to return to
    <i>Canada</i> or towards <i>New England</i>. They told me, they would
    willingly go with us. I desired them to keep it secret, which they did
    not, for being inform’d that Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> and the others
    were coming, they went to meet them, and I was again left alone.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">The Murderers resolve to return to the Habition of
    St. <em>Lewis</em>.</span>The 8th, three Men came to me, one of which was the <i>French</i> Man
    of <i>Provence</i>, with each of them a Horse, sent by our People
    to carry away all the Provisions I had got together, having taken a
    Resolution, as those Persons they had sent told us, to return to the
    Dwelling of St. <i>Lewis</i>, about the Bay of the same Name, from
    whence we came; designing, as they pretended, to build a Boat there,
    to carry them over to the Islands of <i>America</i>; an impracticable
    Notion, for all our Carpenters were dead, and tho’ they had been alive,
    they were so ignorant, that none of them would have known which Way to
    go about that Work; besides that, we were destitute of all Necessaries
    for that Effect. However we must obey, and set out with our Provisions.
    The Rain having detain’d us the 9th on the Way, we could not come up to
    them till the next Day, being the Tenth.</p>

  <p>Father <i>Anastasius</i> gave me the Confirmation of that Design, and
    farther told me how roughly they had been treated by those Murderers
    since my Departure. I know not what it was that mov’d them to it, but
    they had resolved to separate themselves from those Villains, and that
    we should eat apart, <i>viz.</i> Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> the Priest,
    F. <i>Anastasius</i>, young <i>Cavelier</i> and I, which was very
    agreeable to us, because at least we could talk freely, which we durst
    not do before; but at the same Time they allow’d us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span> no more Provisions
    than would suffice to keep us from starving, without giving us Share of
    any Flesh, tho’ they often kill’d.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">The Author and others resolve to part from the
    Murderers.</span>Our Tyrants still holding their Resolution to return to their former
    Habitation, thought they had not Horses enough, and therefore deputed
    four of their Number, one of which was the <i>French</i> Man half
    turn’d <i>Indian</i>, to return to the Village of the <i>Cenis</i> and
    endeavour to barter for some. At the same Time we agreed together to
    let those Gentlemen know, that we were too much fatigued to return with
    them to the said Habitation, and were resolved to remain in the Village
    of the <i>Cenis</i>. Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> undertook to be our
    Speaker, and to desire <i>Duhaut</i>, who was Master of all, to give us
    some Axes, Knives and Strings of Beads, Powder and Shot, offering to
    give him a Note of his Hand for the same.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Design of the Murderers.</span>To conclude, Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> made the Proposal to
    <i>Duhaut</i>, disguis’d it the best he was able, and <i>Duhaut</i>
    took till the next Day to return his answer. He consulted with his
    Companions, and acquainted us, that they would deal handsomely by us,
    and give us half the Effects and all the Axes, intending to make the
    most Speed they could, to get to our former Dwelling, and to put in
    Execution what they had before design’d, as to the Building of a Bark.
    But in Case they could not succeed, for want of Necessaries, they would
    immediately return to us and bring F. <i>Zenobius</i> along with them,
    who would be serviceable to us, because, having been with Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i> upon his first Discovery, he understood the Language
    of the Nations about the <i>Missisipi</i> River. That whilst they were
    upon that Journey, we should take Care to gather a Stock of Provisions,
    and that if they succeeded in building the Bark, they would send us
    Word, that we might repair to them. Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> approv’d
    of all they said, tho’ we had other Designs. However it prov’d we were
    all Mistaken, for Providence had order’d Affairs otherwise.</p>

  <p>We stay’d there some Time, expecting those who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span> gone to the
    <i>Cenis</i>, they staying longer than was requisite for that Journey.
    The overflowing of the River was their Pretence, but the true Reason
    was the Women, who as I have said, are not so forward as to offer
    themselves, but on the other Hand will not be over difficult in
    complying for some little Present, and those who were sent did not
    grudge their Time. In the mean while the Posture of our Affairs
    changed, as follows.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">May 1687</span>
    <span class="sidenote">Murderers change their Mind.</span>
    One of our half Savage <i>French</i> Men, whom I had acquainted
    with our Design to go find the <i>Missisipi</i>, communicated it to
    <i>Hautot</i>,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> telling him all the particulars he had before
    acquainted me with; whereupon <i>Duhaut</i> chang’d his Mind, as to
    the Design of going to the Habitation of St. <i>Lewis</i>, resolving
    to follow our intended Way and execute our Project. He imparted his
    Thoughts to his Companions, who were of the same Opinion, and all
    of them acquainted us, that they were ready to put in Execution the
    Enterprize we had form’d.</p>

  <p>This Change troubled us very much, there being nothing we coveted more
    than to part with those Miscreants, from whom we could at a long Run
    expect no better Usage than they had afforded our Commander and his
    Friends. However, it was still requisite to dissemble, there being no
    other Remedy at that Time: But God’s Justice provided for and rescued
    us. We continued in that Camp all the remaining part of <i>April</i>,
    expecting the Persons that had been sent to the <i>Cenis</i>, and
    <i>Duhaut</i> intending to begin to put in Execution his Design of
    going to find out the <i>Missisipi</i>, with us, made us advance
    towards the River that was near, in order to pass it as soon as fallen,
    and repair to the Village of the <i>Cenis</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Murderers differ in Opinion.</span>We staid three Days longer in that Post, at the End whereof, he we
    call’d <i>Larcheveque</i>, one of those that had been sent out,
    cross’d the River. He was <i>Duhaut’s</i> Creature, and an Accomplice
    in the Murder of Monsieur <i>de la</i> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span><i>Sale</i>. He inform’d<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
    <i>Duhaut</i>, that one they call’d <i>Hiens</i>, who was also one of
    our Messengers, and had stayed on the other Side of the River, had
    heard of <i>Duhaut</i> and the rest altering their Resolution, and
    that he was not of their Mind. <i>Hiens</i> was a <i>Buccanier</i>,
    and by Birth a German. Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> had brought him from
    <i>Petit Gouave</i>, and he was also accessory to the late Murders.</p>

  <p>After we had been some Days longer in the same Place, <i>Hiens</i>
    arriv’d with the two half Savage <i>French</i> Men and about twenty
    Natives. He went immediately to <i>Duhaut</i>, and after some
    Discourse, told him, he was not for going towards the <i>Missisipi</i>,
    because it would be of dangerous Consequence for them, and therefore
    demanded his Share of the Effects he had seiz’d upon. <i>Duhaut</i>
    refusing to comply, and affirming, that all the Axes were his own;
    <i>Hiens</i>,<span class="sidenote"><em>Hiens</em> kills <em>Duhaut</em>, and <em>Ruter Liotot</em>.</span>
    who it is likely had laid the Design before to kill him,
    immediately drew his Pistol, and fired it upon <i>Duhaut</i>, who
    stagger’d about four Paces from the Place and fell down dead. At the
    same Time <i>Ruter</i>, who had been with <i>Hiens</i>, fired his Piece
    upon <i>Liotot</i>, the Surgeon, and shot him thro’ with three Balls.</p>

  <p>These Murders committed before us, put me into a terrible
    Consternation; for believing the same was design’d for me, I laid hold
    of my Fire-Lock to defend my self; but <i>Hiens</i> cry’d out to me,
    to fear nothing, to lay down my Arms, and assur’d me he had no Design
    against me; but that he had reveng’d his Master’s Death. He also
    satisfy’d Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> and Father <i>Anastasius</i>, who
    were as much frighted as my self, declaring he meant them no Harm, and
    that tho’ he had been in the Conspiracy, yet had he been present at
    the Time when Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> was kill’d, he would not have
    consented, but rather have obstructed it.</p>

  <p><i>Liotot</i> liv’d some Hours after, and had the good Fortune to make
    his Confession; after which, the same <i>Ruter</i>, put <span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>him out of his
    Pain, with a Pistol-Shot. We dug a Hole in the Earth, and bury’d him
    in it with <i>Duhaut</i>, doing them more Honour than they had done to
    Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> and his Nephew <i>Moranget</i>, whom they
    left to be devour’d by wild Beasts. Thus those Murderers met with what
    they had deserv’d, dying the same Death they had put others to.</p>

  <p>The Natives, <i>Hiens</i> had brought with him, having been
    Spectators of that Murder, were in a Consternation, and that Affair
    was of dangerous Consequence to us, who stood in Need of them.
    <span class="sidenote">More Mischief prevented.</span> It
    was therefore requisite to make the best of it, giving them to
    understand, that there had been Reason for so punishing those dead
    Persons, because they had all the Powder and Ball, and would not
    give any to the rest. They remain’d satisfy’d with that Excuse, and
    he who was called <i>Larcheveque</i>, and who was entirely devoted
    to <i>Duhaut</i>, being Abroad a hunting since the Morning, and not
    knowing what Misfortune had hapned his Protector, and <i>Hiens</i>
    being resolv’d to make away with him, Father <i>Anastasius</i> and
    Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> took so much Pains, that they disswaded him
    from it, and I went out and met <i>Larcheveque</i>, to give him Notice
    of that Disaster, and to inform him, how he was to behave himself.
    Thus I requited him for having come to give me Notice of Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale’s</i> Death. I brought him to <i>Hiens</i>, who declar’d
    he design’d him no Harm, and <i>Larcheveque</i> gave him the same
    Assurances on his Part. Thus all Things are again compos’d, and nothing
    remain’d, but for us to set out, but first to know what we were to do,
    and which Way to direct our Course.</p>

  <p>Hereupon, <i>Hiens</i> took upon him to speak, and said, he had
    promis’d the Natives to go to the War with them, and design’d to be as
    good as his Word; that if we would expect his Return, we might by that
    Time consider which Way he would move,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and that in the mean Time
    we <span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>might stay in the Village among the <i>Cenis</i>. This was resolv’d
    on; we loaded all our Effects on our Horses, and repair’d to the same
    Place and the same Cottage, where we had been before, the Chief of it
    assigning us the one Half to lodge and lay up our Baggage.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Six French Men go to the Wars with the Natives.</span>
    When the Day for setting out for the War was come, <i>Hiens</i>
    departed with the Natives, four of our Comrades and the two half
    Savage <i>French</i> Men going along with him; so that there were six
    of them, and each took a Horse. <i>Hiens</i> left us all the Effects,
    and desir’d we would stay for him, which we promis’d, not knowing how
    to avoid it, considering, that the <i>Indians</i> might have done
    us Harm, and even have obstructed our Departure. Thus we resign’d
    ourselves to Providence, and remain’d six of us together, <i>viz.</i>
    Father <i>Anastasius</i>, Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i>, his Nephew young
    <i>Cavelier</i>, young <i>Talon</i>, another Youth of <i>Paris</i>, and
    I. There also remain’d some old Men, who could not go to the War, and
    the Women. We were also join’d by two other <i>French</i> Men, who had
    been left on the other Side the River, being the <i>Provencal</i> and
    one <i>Teissier</i>.</p>

  <p>During our Stay, and our Warriors being abroad upon that Expedition,
    the old Men often visited us, and told us News from the Army by Signs,
    which we understood nothing of. We were from Time to Time alarm’d,
    seeing the Women weep, without any visible cause. The late Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i> had often told us,<span class="sidenote">Bewailing
    the Memory of Men kill’d.</span> that the Women bewail’d those
    that were to be kill’d; but we were inform’d, that they did so, when
    they call’d to Mind some who had been slain in the former Wars; which
    dispell’d our Apprehensions. However we were uneasy, because those old
    Men and Women examined us every Morning and Evening when we perform’d
    our Devotions.</p>

  <p>We laid hold of that Opportunity to give them to understand, that we
    paid our Duty to one God, the only Supreme Sovereign of all Things,
    pointing to Heaven, and endeavouring in the best Manner we were able,
    to signify to them that he was Almighty, that he had made all Things,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
    that he caus’d the Earth to produce, it’s Fruits to prosper, and the
    Growth of it, which maintain’d them to thrive; but this being only by
    Signs, they did not understand us, and we labour’d in vain.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Women rejoice at Victory.</span>The 18th, we were surpriz’d to see several Women come into our Cottage,
    their Faces all besmear’d with Earth, and they set up their Throats,
    singing several Songs as loud as they were able,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> whereof we
    understood not one Word. That done, they fell a Dancing in a Ring, and
    we could not tell, what to think of that Rejoicing, which lasted full
    three Hours; after which we were inform’d, they had receiv’d Advice of
    the Victory obtain’d by their Warriors over their Enemies. The Dance
    concluded, those in the Cottage gave some Bits of Tobacco to those
    without.</p>

  <p>The same Day, about Noon, we saw him that had brought the News, who
    affirm’d they had kill’d at least Forty of their Enemies. After the
    Rejoicing, all the Women apply’d themselves to make ready their
    Provisions, some to pound <i>Indian</i> Corn, others to boil Meal,
    which they call <i>Grouller</i>, and others to bake Bread, to carry to
    the Warriors. They all set out the 19th to meet them, and we thought
    it in policy convenient to send Meat to our Men which was done by the
    <i>French</i> Man of <i>Provence</i>, who went with the Women.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Account of the Battle fought by the <em>Cenis</em>.</span>
    That same Day, at Night, the Victorious Army returned, and we were
    informed, that their Enemies whom they call <i>Cannohatinno</i>, had
    expected them boldly, but that having heard the Noise, and felt the
    Effects of our Mens Fire Arms, they all fled, so that the <i>Cenis</i>
    had either kill’d or taken Forty Eight Men and Women. They had slain
    several of the latter, who fled to the Tops of Trees, for want of Time
    to make their Escape otherwise; so that many more Women had perish’d
    than Men.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Barbarity of the Men towards a Woman taken.</span>
    They brought Home two of those Women alive, one of whom had her Head
    flead for the Sake of her Hair and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>Skin. They gave that wretched
    Creature a Charge of Powder and a Ball, and sent Her home, bidding her
    carry that Present to her Nation, and to assure them, they should be
    again treated after the same Manner, that is, kill’d with Fire Arms.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Of the Women.</span>The other Woman
    was kept to fall a Sacrifice to the Rage and Vengeance
    of the Women and Maids; who having arm’d themselves with thick Stakes,
    sharp Pointed at the End, Conducted that Wretch to a By-Place, where
    each of those Furies began to torment her, sometimes with the Point
    of their Staff, and sometimes laying on her with all their Might. One
    tore off her Hair, another cut off her Finger, and every one of those
    outrageous Women endeavour’d to put her to some exquisite Torture, to
    revenge the Death of their Husbands and Kinsmen, who had been kill’d in
    the former Wars; so that the unfortunate Creature expected her Death
    Stroke, as Mercy.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Inhumanity.</span>At last, one of them
    gave her a Stroke with a heavy Club on the Head,
    and another run her Stake several Times into her Body, with which she
    fell down Dead on the Spot. Then they cut that Miserable Victim into
    Morsels, and oblig’d some Slaves of that Nation, they had been long
    possess’d of to eat them.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Cruel Trophies.</span>Thus our Warriors
    return’d Triumphant from that Expedition. They spar’d
    none of the Prisoners they had taken, except two little Boys, and
    brought Home all the Skins of their Heads, with the Hair, to be kept as
    Trophies and glorious Memorials of their Victory.</p>

  <p>The next Day all those Savages met in their Chief’s Cottage, whither
    all the abovemention’d Heads of Hair were carry’d in State. Then they
    made extraordinary Rejoicings in that Cottage, whence they went to
    the Huts of the other Prime Men, to perform the same Ceremony. This
    Rejoicing lasted three Days, our <i>French</i> Companions, who had been
    the Cause of their Victory, being call’d to it, and highly entertain’d,
    after their Manner. It will not be disagreeable to the Reader, that
    I here particularly describe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span> that Ceremony, which after having been
    perform’d in the Cottages of the Chief Men, was repeated in ours.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Ceremony of Rejoicing.</span>In the
    first Place, the Cottage was made very clean, adorn’d, and
    abundant of Mats laid on the Floor, on which the Elders, and the most
    considerable Persons sate; after which, one of them, who is in the
    Nature of an Orator, or Master of the Ceremonies stood up and made a
    Speech, of which we understood not a Word. Soon after that Discourse
    was ended, the Warriors arriv’d, who had slain any in Battle, marching
    in their proper Order, each of them carrying a Bow and two Arrows, and
    before every one of them went his Wife, carrying the Enemies Head of
    Hair. Two little Boys, whose Lives they had spar’d, as has been said
    before, one of them who was wounded being a Horseback, clos’d the
    procession; at the Head whereof, was a Woman carrying a large Reed, or
    Cane in her Hand.</p>

  <p>As they came up to the Orator, the Warrior took the Head of Hair his
    Wife had brought, and presented it to him, which the said Orator
    receiv’d with both his Hands, and after having held it out towards the
    four Quarters of the World, he laid it down on the Ground, and then
    took the next, performing the same Ceremony, till he had gone over them all.</p>

  <p>When the Ceremony was ended, they serv’d up the <i>Sagamite</i>, in
    the Nature of Hasty Pudding, which those Women had provided, and
    before any one touch’d it, the Master of the Ceremonies took some in a
    Vessel, which he carry’d as an Offering to those Heads of Hair. Then he
    lighted a Pipe of Tabacco, and blow’d the Smoke upon them. That being
    perform’d, they all fell to the Meat, <i>Bits of the Woman that had
      been sacrific’d were served up to the two Boys of her Nation</i>. They
    also serv’d up dry’d Tongues of their Enemies, and the whole concluded
    with Dancing and Singing after their Manner: After which, they went to
    other Cottages to repeat the same Ceremony.</p>

  <p>There was no talk of our Design till those Rejoycings were over, and
    I began to conceive good Hopes of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span> Success. The two Murderers,
    <i>Teissier</i> and <i>Larcheveque</i>, who had both a Hand in the
    Death of Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i>, had promis’d to go along with us,
    provided Monsr. <i>Cavelier</i> would pardon them, and he had given
    them his Word so to do. In this Expectation we continu’d till the 25th,
    when our French Men, who had been at the War, repair’d to our Cottage,
    and we consulted about our Business.</p>

  <p><i>Hiens</i> and others of his Gang, disapproving of our Design,
    represented to us such Difficulties as they look’d upon to be
    unsurmountable, under which we must inevitably perish, or at least be
    oblig’d to return to the same Place. <i>Hiens</i> told us, that for his
    own Part, he would not hazard his Life to return into <i>France</i>,
    only to have his Head chopp’d off, and perceiving we answer’d Nothing
    to that, but that we persisted in our Resolution, <em>It is requisite
    then</em>, said he, <em>to divide what Effects remain.</em></p>

  <p><span class="sidenote"><em>Hiens</em> gives the others what he pleases, and seizes the
    rest of the Effects.</span>Accordingly he laid aside, for F. <i>Anastasius</i>, Messieurs
    <i>Cavelier</i>, the Uncle and the Nephew,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> thirty Axes, four or
    five Dozens of Knives, about thirty Pounds of Powder and the like
    Quantity of Ball. He gave each of the others two Axes, two Knives,
    two or three Pounds of Powder, with as much Ball, and kept the rest.
    As for the Horses, he kept the best and left us the three least.
    Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> ask’d him for some Strings of Beads, which
    he granted, and seiz’d upon all the late Monsr. <i>de la Sale’s</i>
    Cloaths, Baggage and other Effects, besides above a thousand Livres
    in Money, which belong’d to the late Monsr. <i>le Gros</i>, who dy’d
    at our Dwelling of St. <i>Lewis</i>. Before our Departure, it was a
    sensible Affliction to us, to see that Villain walk about, in a scarlet
    Coat, with Gold Galons, which had belong’d to the late Monsr. <i>de la
    Sale</i>, and which, as I have said, he had seiz’d.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Mr. <em>Cavelier</em> and his Company part from the
    others.</span>After that, <i>Hiens</i> and his Companions withdrew to their own
    Cottage, and we resolv’d not to put off our Departure <span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>any longer.
    Accordingly, we made ready our Horses, which much alarm’d the Natives,
    and especially the Chief of them, who said and did all he could to
    obstruct our Journey, promising us Wives, Plenty of Provisions,
    representing to us the immense Dangers, as well from Enemies, who
    surrounded them, as from the bad and impassable Ways and the many Woods
    and Rivers we were to pass. However, we were not to be moved, and only
    ask’d one Kindness of him, in obtaining of which, there were many
    difficulties, and it was, that he would give us Guides to conduct us to
    <i>Cappa</i>; but at length, after much Trouble and many Promises of a
    good Reward, one was granted, and two others went along with him.</p>

  <p>All Things being thus order’d for our Departure, we took Leave of
    our Hosts, pass’d by <i>Heins</i>’s Cottage and embrac’d him and his
    Companions. We ask’d him for another Horse, which he granted. He
    desired an Attestation in <i>Latin</i> of Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i>,
    that he had not been concern’d in the Murder of Monsieur <i>de la
    Sale</i>, which was given him, because there was no refusing of it; and
    we set forward without <i>Larcheveque</i> and <i>Meunier</i>,<span class="sidenote"><em>French</em>
    Men stay with the <em>Indians</em>.</span> who did
    not keep their Word with us, but remain’d among those Barbarians, being
    infatuated with that Course of Libertinism they had run themselves
    into. Thus there were only seven of us<span class="sidenote">Only seven
    set out for <em>Canada</em>.</span> that stuck together to return
    to <i>Canada</i>, <i>viz.</i> Father <i>Anastasius</i>, Messieurs
    <i>Cavelier</i> the Uncle and the Nephew, the Sieur <i>de Marle</i>,
    one <i>Teissier</i>, a young Man born at <i>Paris</i>, whose Name was
    <i>Bartholomew</i> and I, with six horses and the three <i>Indians</i>,
    who were to be our Guides; a very small Number for so great an
    Enterprize, but we put ourselves entirely into the Hands of Divine
    Providence, confiding in God’s Mercy, which did not forsake us.</p>

  <p>After the first Day’s Journey we incamp’d on the Bank of the River, we
    had left not long before, lay there that Night, and the next Day, cut
    down Trees to make a Sort of Bridge or Planks to pass over it; handing
    over our Goods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span> from one to another, and swimming over our Horses;
    which Work we were frequently oblig’d to repeat, and as often as we had
    afterwards Occasion to pass Rivers on our Way, which we held on till
    the 29th, every Day meeting with some Cottage, and at last, a Hamlet or
    Village, into which we went, and the <i>Indian</i> Inhabitants told us,
    they were call’d <i>Nahordikhe</i>,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and that they were Allies to
    the <i>Cenis</i>.</p>

  <p>We barter’d with them for some Provisions, and their Chief offer’d to
    go with us as far as the <i>Assonys</i>,<span class="sidenote"><em>Nahordikhes</em>
    and <em>Assony</em>.</span> who were not farther off than
    about three Leagues, which he accordingly did; but it happening to
    rain when we came thither, and the <i>Assonys</i> having had no Notice
    before hand, we found but indifferent Reception.</p>

  <p>However, we were conducted to the Chief’s Cottage; the Elders had
    Notice given them, they resorted thither, and when our Horses were
    unloaded, and our Goods plac’d in a Corner of the Cottage, which the
    Chief had allotted us, we gave them to understand, that our Intention
    was to go farther, to fetch Commodities to trade with them, at which
    they were pleas’d. They gave us to eat, and the Elders stay’d some Part
    of the Evening with us, which made us somewhat Uneasy, and oblig’d us
    to be upon our Guard; however the Night pass’d without any Disturbance.</p>

  <p>The next Morning the Elders came to us again. They had provided Mats
    without the Cottage, and made Signs to us to go thither and sit down
    upon them, as we did, leaving two of our Company to guard the Baggage.
    We repeated to them what we had said the Night before, and made them
    some Presents of Axes, Knives, Strings of Beads and Rings. They
    signify’d they were sorry we would go away, and endeavour’d the best
    they could, to make us sensible of the same Obstacles the others had
    signify’d to us; but it was all in Vain; however, we stay’d till the
    first of <i>June</i>, all the while bartering and gathering the best
    stock of Provisions we could.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">June 1687</span>The Second, we remov’d from that Cottage, where we had some Jealousy,
    and went to another, a Quarter of a League from it, where the Chief
    of it gave us a very good Reception.<span class="sidenote">Good Entertainment.</span>
    An old Woman, who was either his
    Mother, or Governess of the Cottage, took particular Care of us: We
    were first serv’d at eating, and to keep her in that good Mind, we now
    and then made her some little Presents, whilst she, by her Care and
    Kindness, spar’d our Provisions, which were necessary for our Journey.</p>

  <p>A continual Rain oblig’d us to stay there till the 13th. During our
    Stay, the Natives made several Feasts, to which we were always invited;
    and at length the Rain ceasing, we resolv’d to set out, notwithstanding
    all Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> the Priest’s Apprehensions, which we
    surmounted, and directed our Course towards the <i>N. E.</i> with
    two <i>Indians</i>, who were to conduct us only a small Way, and who
    accordingly soon left us, whatsoever Promises we could make them. They
    departed to return Home, promising they would come to us again. We
    encamp’d that Night on the Bank of a Rivulet.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Bad Ways.</span>The 14th and 15th, we held on our Way, frequently meeting with Sloughs,
    which very much fatigued us, because we were oblig’d to unload our
    Horses for them to pass, and prevent their sticking in the Mire and fat
    Soil, whence we could not have drawn them out, and consequently we were
    fain to carry all our Luggage on our own Backs.</p>

  <p>Whilst we halted about Noon, that our Horses might graze, as was
    usually done by us, we discover’d our two <i>Assony Indians</i>
    returning towards us, at which we were much rejoiced, because they had
    a better Notion than ourselves of the Way we were to go. We made them
    eat and smoke, and then set out again.</p>

  <p>The 16th, we came to a great River, which we pass’d as we had done the
    first, and after that, met with very bad Ways.</p>

  <p>The 17th, one of our Company being indispos’d, we could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span> not set out
    till Noon, and held on till the 21st, crossing several Sloughs and
    Rivers, and then one of our <i>Indians</i> being out of Order, it
    oblig’d us to stay on the Bank of a River we had pass’d. The other
    <i>Indian</i> seeing his comrade sick, went a Hunting, and brought a
    wild Goat; for there are many in that Country. The <i>Indians</i> have
    the <span class="sidenote">Art to Kill Goats and Wild Fowl.</span>
    Art of dressing the Heads of those Creatures, which they put upon
    their own, and imitate them so exactly, that they can come very near
    to them, and then seldom fail of killing. The same Method they use for
    Turkeys and other wild Fowl, and so draw them close to themselves.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Fine Meadows.</span>The 22d, our <i>Indian</i> being somewhat recover’d we decamp’d and
    proceeded along a better Way and Pleasanter Country, than that we
    had left behind, and as we enquir’d the best we could of those our
    <i>Indians</i>, concerning the Neighbouring Nations and those we
    were going towards, among others they nam’d to us, that they call’d
    <i>Cappa</i>. M. <i>Cavelier</i> told us, he remember’d he had
    heard his late Brother Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> name that Nation,
    and say he had seen it as he went from <i>Canada</i> towards the
    <i>Missisipi</i>. This put us in Hopes, that we should succeed in our Discovery.</p>

  <p>The 23d, being near a Village, we had been in Search of, one of our
    <i>Indians</i> went before, to give Notice of our Arrival. In the
    mean Time we cross’d most lovely Plains and Meadows, border’d with
    fine Groves of beautiful Trees, where the Grass was so high, that it
    hinder’d our Horses going, and were oblig’d to clear the Passage for them.</p>

  <p>When we were within Half a League of the Village, we saw an
    <i>Indian</i>, mounted on a large grey Mare, coming along with our
    Native, to meet us, and were told, that Horseman was the Chief of the
    Village, attended by some others of the same Place. As soon as that
    Chief came up to us, he express’d very much Kindness and Affection; we
    gave him to understand, that we did no Body any Harm, unless we were
    first attack’d. Then we made him smoke, and when that was done, he made
    Signs to us to follow him, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span> we did, till we came to the Bank of a
    River, where he again desir’d us to stay, whilst he went to give Notice
    to the Elders.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote"><em>M. Cavelier</em> and the rest carry’d on the Backs of
    Indians.</span>Soon after, a Number of them came, and having join’d us, signify’d,
    that they were come to carry us to their Village. Our <i>Indians</i>
    made Signs, that it was the Custom of the Country, and we must
    submit, and let them do as they thought fit. Tho’ we were much out of
    Countenance at that Ceremony, seven of the prime Men among them would
    have us mount on their Backs or Shoulders. Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i>
    being our Chief, mounted first, and then the rest did the same.</p>

  <p>As for my own Part, being of a pretty large Size and loaded with
    Cloaths, a Firelock, a Case of Pistols, Powder and Ball, a Kettle and
    other Implements, there is no Doubt but I made a sufficient Burden for
    him that carry’d me, and because I was taller than he and my Feet would
    have hung upon the Ground, two other <i>Indians</i> held them up for
    me; so that I had three to carry me. Other <i>Indians</i> took hold of
    our Horses to lead them, and in that ridiculous Equipage we arriv’d at
    the Village. Our Carriers, who had gone a long Quarter of a League,
    had need enough to rest, and we to be set down, that we might laugh in
    private, for it behov’d us to take Care not to do it before them.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Ceremonies at their Reception.</span>
    As soon as we were come to the Chief’s Cottage, where we found above
    two hundred Persons, who were come to see us, and that our Horses were
    unloaded, the Elders gave us to understand, that it was their Custom
    to wash Strangers at their first Coming; but that we being clad, they
    would only wash our Faces; which one of those elders did, with fair
    Water they had in a Sort of Earthen Vessel, and he only wash’d our
    Forehead.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Speeches made to them.</span>
    After this second Ceremony, the Chief made Signs to us, to sit down on
    a Sort of little Scaffold, rais’d about 4 Foot above the Ground, and
    made of Wood and Canes, where when we were plac’d, the Chiefs of the
    Villages being four in Number, came and made Speeches to us, one after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
    another. We listened to them with Patience, tho’ we understood not one
    Word of what they said to us; being tir’d with the Length of their
    Harangues, and much more with the violent Heat of the Sun, which was
    just over our Heads.</p>

  <p>When the Speeches were ended, the Purport whereof, as near as we could
    guess, was only to assure us, that we were very welcome; we gave them
    to understand, that we were going into our own Country, designing to
    return speedily, to bring them several Sorts of Commodities and such
    Things as they should stand in need of.</p>

  <p>Next, we made them the usual Presents of Axes, Knives, Strings of
    Beads, Needles and Pins, for their Wives, telling them, that when we
    return’d we would give them more.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Their Entertainment.</span>
    We farther signify’d to them, that if they would afford us some Corn or
    Meal, we would give them other Things in Exchange, which they agreed
    to. After this they made us eat <i>Sagamite</i>, or Hasty-pudding,
    Bread, Beans, Pompions and other Things, which we had sufficient Need
    of. Most of us having scarce eaten any Thing all that Day, some for
    Want, and others out of Devotion, as Monsr. <i>Cavelier</i>, who would
    observe the Fast of St. <i>John Baptist</i>’s Eve, whose Name he bore.
    It is to be observ’d, that the Pompions are incomparably better there,
    than with us.</p>

  <p>The 24th, the Elders met again in our Cottage. We gave them to
    understand, they would oblige us,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> in furnishing Guides to conduct
    us to the Village of <i>Cappa</i>, which was in our Way; but instead
    of granting it, they earnestly intreated us, to stay with them and go
    to the Wars against their Enemies, having been told Wonders of our
    Firelocks, which we promis’d to do when we return’d, and that it should
    be shortly, and they seem’d to rest satisfy’d.</p>

  <p>Thus our Hopes increas’d, but the Joy it occasion’d was allay’d by a
    dismal Accident that befell us.<span class="sidenote">Mr. <em>de Marle</em>
    drown’d.</span> Monsieur <i>de Marle</i>, one of the
    prime Men of our Company, having Breakfasted, would needs go Bath
    himself in the River we <span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>had pass’d the Day before, and not knowing
    how to swim, he went too far and step’d into a Hole, whence he could
    not recover himself, but was unfortunately drowned. Young Monsieur
    <i>Cavelier</i>, having been told that Monsieur <i>de Marle</i> was
    going to Bath himself, ran after him, and coming to the River, saw he
    was drowning, he ran back to acquaint us: We hasted thither with a
    Number of <i>Indians</i>, who were there before us; but all too late,
    some of them div’d, and brought him up dead from the Bottom of the Water.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">His Funeral.</span>
    We carry’d him to the Cottage, shedding many Tears, the <i>Indians</i>
    bore Part in our Sorrow, and we paid him the last Duties, offering
    up the usual Prayers; after which he was buryed in a small Field,
    behind the Cottage; and whereas, during that doleful Ceremony, we
    pray’d, reading in our Books, particularly Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i>,
    the Priest and Father <i>Anastasius</i>, the <i>Indians</i> gaz’d on
    us with Amazement, because we talk’d, looking upon the Leaves, and we
    endeavour’d to give them to understand, that we pray’d to God for the
    dead Man, pointing up to Heaven.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Humanity of the Indians.</span>
    We must do this Right to those good People, as to declare, that they
    express’d singular Humanity upon that doleful Accident, as appear’d by
    the sensible Testimony of their Actions, and all the Methods they us’d
    to let us understand how great a Share they bore in our Sorrow; which
    we should not have found in several Parts of <i>Europe</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Indian Ceremony to the Dead.</span>
    During our short Stay in that Place, we observ’d a Ceremony that was
    perform’d by the Chief’s Wife, <i>viz.</i> that every Morning she went
    to Monsieur <i>de Marle’s</i> Grave, and carry’d a little Basket of
    parch’d Ears of Corn to lay on it, the meaning whereof we could not
    understand. Before our Departure, we were inform’d, that the Villages
    belonging to our Hosts, being four in Number, all ally’d together
    were call’d,<span class="sidenote">Indian Nations.</span>
    <i>Assony</i>, <i>Natsohsos</i>, <i>Nachitos</i> and <i>Cadodaquio</i>.</p>

  <p>On the 27th, having been inform’d by the Natives, that we should find
    Canoes, to pass a River that was on our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span> Way, Father <i>Anastasius</i>
    and I went to see whether, what they told us was true. We found that
    River was a Branch of the same we had already pass’d, the Channel of it
    being pleasant and navigable, and saw some Canoes, in one of which the
    <i>Indians</i> carry’d us over to the other Side, whether we went to
    see what convenient Place there was for our Horses to come ashore. We
    found a very proper Place, and returning, made our Report to Monsieur
    <i>Cavelier</i>, who being then much out of Order with Pains in his
    Feet, we were oblig’d to stay there, till the 30th.</p>

  <p>During that Time, we were frequently visited by the <i>Indians</i>,
    both Old and Young, and of both Sexes, and even the Chiefs of the
    Nation, call’d <i>Janiquo</i>,<span class="sidenote"><em>Janiquo</em> Nation.</span>
    came to see us, and with them we often
    convers’d in dumb Show, and every Evening the Women, attended by the
    Warriors, with their Bows and Arrows, resorted to our Cottage, to
    sing a doleful<span class="sidenote">Doleful Entertainment.</span>
    Sort of Song, shedding Tears at the same Time. This
    would have given us some Uneasiness, had we not before seen the same
    Ceremony, and been inform’d, that those Women repair in that Manner
    to the Chief’s Cottage, to intreat him, singing and weeping, to take
    Revenge on those, who have kill’d their Husbands, or Relations, in
    former Wars, as I have observ’d before. In all other Respects, the
    Manners and Customs of this Nation, being much the same as those of the
    <i>Cenis</i>, I shall add no more concerning them.</p>

  <p>The 29th, at Night, we gave Notice to the Chief, that we would set out
    the next Day, we made him some Presents in particular, and the like
    to his Wife, because she had taken special Care of us, and departed
    on the 30th. The Chief, attended by many other <i>Indians</i>, whom
    we found in the Cottages on our Way, went to Conduct us as far as the
    River, which we cross’d in Canoes, and swam over our Horses. There we
    took Leave of our Conductors, to whom we gave some Strings of Beads for
    their Wives, and their Chief would needs Conduct us to the next Village.</p>

  <p>By the Way we came to a Cottage, where our Guide made us halt, and
    there they gave us to eat. Then we held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span> on our Journey to a Village
    call’d <i>Cadodaquio</i>, and were conducted to the Chief’s Cottage,
    <span class="sidenote"><em>Cadodaquio</em> Village.</span>
    who receiv’d us courtiously, being a Friend to him that went with us.
    It was requisite to unload our Horses to lie there, and we signified to
    the Chief, that we stood in Need of Provisions. He spoke to the Women,
    who brought us some Meal, which we purchased with Strings of Beads, and
    the Chief, who conducted us thither, took his Leave.</p>

  <p>Having no Design to stay there any Time, we had desired the
    Chief to appoint some Person to guide us to the Village call’d
    <i>Cahainihoüa</i>, which was in our Way. It happen’d by good Fortune,
    that there were then in that Place some Men and Women of the said
    Village, who were come to fetch some Wood, fit to make Bows, there
    being Plenty of that Sort of Trees they make them of, about the Village
    we were in. We signify’d our Design to them and they gave us to
    understand they would be glad to bear us Company. In the Conversation
    we had with them, they made us comprehend, that they had seen People
    like us, who had Firelocks and a House, and that they were acquainted
    with the <i>Cappa’s</i>, which was very pleasing to us. Because they
    were not to depart till two Days after, we resolv’d to stay for them.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Peculiar Custom.</span>
    We observ’d, that there was a Difference between the Language of those
    People and the Inhabitants of the Village we were in, from that of the
    <i>Cenis</i>, and that they had some peculiar Ceremonies, one whereof
    is, that when the Women have their Terms, they leave the Company of
    their Husbands and withdraw into other Cottages appointed for that
    Purpose, which no Person is to come near, upon Pain of being reputed unclean.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">July 1687</span>
    <span class="sidenote">Ornaments of Women.</span>
    Those Women have their Faces still more disfigur’d, than the others
    we had seen before; for they make several Streaks, or Scores on them,
    whereas the others had but one. They adorn themselves with little Locks
    of fine red Hair; which they make fast to their Ears in the Nature of
    Pendants. In other Respects they are not disagreeable, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span> neither
    Women nor Maids are so ill-natur’d as to make their Lovers pine for
    them. They are not difficult of Access, and they soon make a Return for
    a small Present.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">The Men.</span>
    The Men wear their Hair short, like our <i>Capucins</i>, they anoint
    it with a sort of Oyl, or Grease, and curl it like snails, after which
    they strew on it a Sort of Down, or Lint, died red, as we do Powder,
    which is done when they design to be very fine, in order to appear in
    their Assemblies. They are very fond of their Children, and all the Way
    of chastising them they use, is to throw Water at them, without ever
    beating or giving them ill Words.</p>

  <p>The <i>Indians</i> that were of the Village of <i>Cohainihoua</i><a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
    and to conduct us thither, not being ready to set out on
    <i>Wednesday</i> the 2d of <i>July</i>, as they had promis’d, a young
    <i>Indian</i> offer’d himself, saying, he would conduct us safe
    thither, and we set out with him, still directing our Course towards
    the <i>N. E.</i> We kept close along the same River we had cross’d, and
    found it very pleasant and navigable, the Banks of it cover’d with fine
    Trees of several Sorts.</p>

  <p>We had not travell’d above a League, before our Guide gave us to
    understand, that he had forgot a Piece of hard dry’d Skin he had to
    make him Shoes, which he would go fetch and return to us, pointing to
    us with his Hand, which Way we were to go, and telling us we should
    soon come to a River.</p>

  <p>This sudden Change in the <i>Indian</i> was somewhat surprizing and
    very much perplex’d us; however we held on our Way, and soon came to
    the River he had mention’d to us, which was very pleasant and deep. We
    cross’d it the next Day, on a Sort of Float, which we made with much
    Toil and Labour, and our Horses swam over. Some Time after we were
    passed, we saw the <i>Indians</i> coming, who had promised to bear us
    Company, and were glad to find our Float, to cross the same River, as
    they did, and proceeded on our Journey all together.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

  <p>The 4th, 5th and 6th, we did the same, crossing a very fine Country,
    but water’d by many Brooks, Streams and Rivers.<span class="sidenote">Plenty
    of Game.</span> We found Abundance of
    wild Goats, Turkeys and other wild Fowl, whereof our <i>Indians</i>
    kill’d many.</p>

  <p>On the 6th, whilst we halted on the Bank of a River to eat, we heard
    the Tingling of some small Bells; which making us look about, we spy’d
    an <i>Indian</i> with a naked Sword-Blade in his Hand, adorned with
    Feathers of several Colours, and two large Hawks Bells, that occasion’d
    the Noise we had heard.</p>

  <p>He made Signs for us to come to him, and gave us to understand, that he
    was sent by the Elders of the Village, whither we were going, to meet
    us, caressing us after an extraordinary Manner. I observ’d that it was
    a Spanish Blade he had, and that he took Pleasure in ringing the Hawks
    Bells.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Kind Reception.</span>
    Having travell’d about half a League with him, we discover’d a Dozen
    of other <i>Indians</i> coming towards us, who made very much of and
    conducted us the Village, to the Chief’s Cottage, where we found dry’d
    Bear-Skins laid on the Ground, and they made us sit on them, where we
    were treated with Eatables, as were the Elders after us, and a Throng
    of Women came to see us.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Presents.</span>
    The 7th, the Elders came to give us a Visit, bringing us two Bullocks
    Hides, four Otters Skins, one white Wild-Goat’s Skin, all of them well
    dry’d, and 4 Bows, in Return for the Present we had before made them.
    The Chief and another came again some Time after, bringing two Loaves,
    the finest and the best we had yet seen. They look’d as if they had
    been bak’d in an Oven, and yet we had not observ’d, that there were
    Ovens among any of them. That Chief stay’d with us some Hours, he
    seem’d to be very ingenious and discreet, and easily understood our
    Signs, which were most of the Language we had. Having order’d a little
    Boy to bring us all we had Occasion for, he withdrew.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">The Ceremony of the Pipe.</span>
    Towards the Evening, we were entertain’d with a Ceremony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span> we had not
    seen before. A Company of Elders, attended by some young Men and Women
    came to our Cottage in a Body, singing as loud as they could roar.
    The foremost of them had a <i>Calumet</i>, so they call a very long
    Sort of Tabacco Pipe, adorn’d with several Sorts of Feathers. When
    they had sung a while, before our Cottage, they enter’d it, still
    singing on, for about a Quarter of an Hour. After that, they took
    Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> the Priest, as being our Chief, led him in
    solemn Manner out of the Cottage, supporting him under the Arms. When
    they were come to a Place they had prepared, one of them laid a great
    Handful of Grass under his feet, two others brought fair Water in an
    Earthen Dish, with which they wash’d his Face, and then made him sit
    down on a Skin, provided for that Purpose.</p>

  <p>When Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> was seated, the Elders took their Places,
    sitting round about him, and the Master of the Ceremonies fix’d in the
    Ground two little wooden Forks, and having laid a Stick across them,
    all being painted red, he placed on them a Bullock’s Hide, dryed, a
    Goat’s Skin over that, and then laid the Pipe thereon.</p>

  <p>The Song was begun again, the Women mixing in the Chorus, and the
    Concert was heightned by great hollow Calabashes or Gourds, in which
    there were large Gravel Stones, to make a Noise, the <i>Indians</i>
    striking on them by Measure, to answer the Tone of the Choir; and the
    pleasantest of all was, that one of the <i>Indians</i> plac’d himself
    behind Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> to hold him up, whilst at the same Time
    he shook and dandled him from Side to Side, the Motion answering to the
    Musick.</p>

  <p>That Concert was scarce ended, when the Master of the Ceremonies
    brought two Maids, the one having in her Hand a Sort of Collar, and
    the other an Otter’s Skin, which they plac’d on the wooden Forks
    abovemention’d, at the Ends of the Pipe. Then he made them sit down,
    on each Side of Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i>, in such a Posture, that they
    look’d one upon the other, their Legs extended and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span> intermix’d, on
    which the same Master of the Ceremonies laid Monsieur <i>Cavelier’s</i>
    Legs, in such Manner, that they lay uppermost and across those of the
    two Maids.</p>

  <p>Whilst this Action was performing, one of the Elders made fast a dy’d
    Feather to the back Part of Monsieur <i>Cavelier’s</i> Head, tying
    it to his Hair. The Singing still continu’d all that Time, so that
    Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> grown weary of its Tediousness, and asham’d
    to see himself in that Posture between two Maids, without knowing
    to what Purpose, made Signs to us to signify the same to the Chief,
    and having given him to understand, that he was not well, two of the
    <i>Indians</i> immediately took hold of him under the Arms, conducted
    him back to the Cottage and made Signs to him to take his Rest. This
    was about Nine in the Evening, and the <i>Indians</i> spent all the
    Night in Singing, insomuch that some of them could hold out no longer.</p>

  <p>In the Morning they return’d to Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i>, conducted
    him again out of the Cottage, with the same Ceremony and made him
    sit down, still singing on. Then the Master of the Ceremonies took
    the Pipe, which he fill’d with Tabacco, lighted and offered it to
    Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i>, but drawing back and advancing six Times
    before he gave it him. Having at last put it into his Hands, Monsieur
    <i>Cavelier</i> made as if he had smok’d and return’d it to them. Then
    they made us all smoke round, and every one of them whiff’d in his
    Turn, the Musick still continuing.</p>

  <p>About Nine in the Morning, the Sun growing very hot, and Monsieur
    <i>Cavelier</i> being bare Headed, made Signs that it did him Harm.
    Then at last they gave over singing, and conducted him back into the
    Cottage, took the Pipe, put it into a Case, made of a Wild-Goat’s Skin,
    with the two wooden Forks and the red Stick that lay across them, all
    which one of the Elders offer’d to Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i>, assuring
    him that he might pass thro’ all the Nations that were ally’d to them
    by Virtue of that Token of Peace, and should be every where well
    receiv’d.<span class="sidenote"><em>Cahaynohoua</em> Nation.</span>
    This was the first Place where we saw the <i>Calumet</i>, or
    Pipe of Peace,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span> having no Knowledge of it before, as some have writ.
    This Nation is call’d <i>Cahaynohoua</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote"><em>Indians</em> expect Presents.</span>
    This Sort of Ceremonies being never perform’d among the <i>Indians</i>
    without the Expectation of receiving some Present, and we having
    besides observ’d, that some of them had withdrawn themselves, with
    Tokens of Dissatisfaction, perhaps because we had interrupted their
    Ceremony, we thought it convenient to give them something more, and
    I was appointed to carry them an Ax, four Knives and some Strings of
    Beads, with which they were satisfied.</p>

  <p>We afterwards shew’d them an Experiment of our Arms, the Noise and Fire
    whereof frighted them. They earnestly press’d us to stay with them,
    offering us Wives and whatsoever else we should want. To be the better
    quit of them, we promis’d to return, saying we were going to fetch
    Commodities, Arms and Tools, which we stood in Need of, that we might
    afterwards stay with them.</p>

  <p>The 9th and 10th were spent in Visits, and we were inform’d by one of
    the <i>Indians</i> that we were not far from a great River, which he
    describ’d with a Stick on the Sand, and shew’d it had two Branches, at
    the same Time pronouncing the word <i>Cappa</i>, which, as I have said,
    is a Nation near the <i>Missisipi</i>. We then made no longer Question,
    that we were near what we had been so long looking after. We entreated
    the Elders to appoint some men to conduct us, promising to reward them
    well, which they granted, and we set out the 11th, to the great Sorrow
    of those good People, who had entertain’d us so courteously.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">The Journey prosecuted.</span>
    We travell’d several different Ways, which we could never have found,
    had we wanted Guides, and so proceeded till on the 12th, one of our
    Guides pretended to be sick, and made Signs that he would go back;
    but observing, that we seem’d to be no Way concern’d, which we did on
    Purpose, he consulted with his Companion, and then came to tell us, he
    was recover’d. We made him eat and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span> smoke, and continued our Journey
    the 13th, finding the Way very bad and difficult.</p>

  <p>The 14th, our <i>Indians</i>, having seen the Track of Bullocks,
    signify’d they would go kill some, to eat the Flesh, which made us halt
    for two or three Hours. Whilst we stay’d for our Hunters, we prepar’d
    some <i>Sagamite</i>, or their Sort of Hasty-Pudding. They return’d
    loaded with Flesh, Part whereof we dress’d, and eat it with very good
    Stomachs. Then we proceeded on our Journey till the 18th, and by the
    Way kill’d three Bullocks and two Cows, which oblig’d us to halt, that
    we might use of our Flesh, drying it.</p>

  <p>The Night between the 19th and the 20th, one of our Horses breaking
    loose, was either taken away by the Natives, or lost in the Woods.
    That did not obstruct our Departure, tho’ the Loss was grievous to
    us, and we held on our Way till the 24th, when we met a Company of
    <i>Indians</i>, with Axes, going to fetch Barks of Trees, to cover
    their Cottages.<span class="sidenote">Indians with Axes.</span>
    They were surpriz’d to see us, but having made Signs to
    them to draw near, they came, caress’d and presented us with some Water
    Melons they had. They put off their Design of going to fetch Bark till
    another Time, and went along with us, and one of our Guides having gone
    before in the Morning to give Notice of our coming at the next Village,
    met with other Parcels of <i>Indians</i>, who were coming to meet us,
    and express’d extraordinary Kindness.</p>

  <p>We halted in one of their Cottages, which they call <i>Desert</i>,
    because they are in the Midst of their Fields and Gardens. There we
    found several Women who had brought Bread, Gourds, Beans and Water
    Melons, a Sort of Fruit proper to quench Thirst, the Pulp of it being
    no better than Water.</p>

  <p>We set out again to come to the Village, and by the Way, met with very
    pleasant Woods, in which, there were Abundance of stately Cedars. Being
    come to a River, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span> was between us and the Village, and looking
    over to the further Side, we discover’d a great Cross,<span class="sidenote">A
    Cross by a River and a French built House.</span> and at a small
    Distance from it, a House, built after the <i>French</i> Fashion.</p>

  <p>It is easy to imagine what inward Joy we conceiv’d at the Sight of
    that Emblem of our Salvation. We knelt down, lifting up our Hands
    and Eyes to Heaven, to return Thanks to the Divine Goodness, for
    having conducted us so happily; for we made no Question of finding
    <i>French</i> on the other Side of the River, and of their being
    Catholicks, since they had Crosses.</p>

  <p>In short, having halted some Time on the Bank of that River, we spy’d
    several Canoes making towards us, and two Men cloath’d, coming out of
    the House we had discover’d, who, the Moment they saw us, fir’d each of
    them a Shot to salute us. An <i>Indian</i> being Chief of the Village,
    who was with them, had done so before, and we were not backward in
    returning their Salute, by discharging all our Pieces.</p>

  <p>When we had pass’d the River, and were all come together, we soon
    knew each other to be <i>French</i> Men.<span class="sidenote">Dwelling
    of French.</span> Those we found were the
    Sieurs <i>Couture Charpantier</i> and <i>de Launay</i>, both of them
    of <i>Roan</i>, whom Monsieur <i>de Tonty</i>, Governor of Fort St.
    <i>Lewis</i> among the <i>Islinois</i>, had left at that Post, when he
    went down the <i>Missisipi</i> to look after Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i>;
    and the Nation we were then with, was call’d <i>Accancea</i>.</p>

  <p>It is hard to express the Joy conceiv’d on both Sides; ours was
    unspeakable, for having at last found, what we had so earnestly
    desired, and that the Hopes of returning to our dear Country, was in
    some Measure assured by that happy Discovery.<span class="sidenote">The
    Travellers come to the French Habitation.</span> The others were pleased
    to see such Persons as might bring them News of that Commander, from
    whom they expected the Performance of what he had promis’d them; but
    the Account we gave them of Monsr. <i>de la Sale’s</i> unfortunate
    Death, was so afflicting, that it drew Tears from them, and the
    dismal History of his Troubles and Disasters render’d them almost
    inconsolable.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

  <p>We were conducted to the House, whither all our Baggage was honestly
    carry’d by the <i>Indians</i>. There was a very great Throng of those
    People, both Men and Women, which being over, we came to the Relation
    of the particular Circumstances of our Stories. Ours was deliver’d by
    Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i>, whom we honour’d as our Chief, for being
    Brother to him, who had been so.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Who the Frenchmen were.</span>We were inform’d by them, that they had been Six, sent by Monsr.
    <i>Tonty</i>, when he return’d from the Voyage he had made down the
    <i>Colbert</i> or <i>Missisipi</i> River, pursuant to the Orders
    sent him by the late Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i>, at his Departure from
    <i>France</i>, and that the said Sieur <i>Tonty</i> had commanded them
    to build the aforesaid House. That having never since receiv’d any News
    from the said Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i>, Four of them were gone back to
    Monsr. <i>Tonty</i>, at the Fort of the <i>Islinois</i>.</p>

  <p>In Conclusion, it was agreed among us, to go away as soon as possible,
    towards the <i>Islinois</i>, and conceal from the <i>Indians</i>, the
    Death of Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, to keep them still in Awe and
    under Submission, whilst we went away with the first Ships that should
    happen to sail from <i>Canada</i> for <i>France</i>, to give an Account
    at Court of what had happen’d, and to procure Succours. In the mean
    Time, the Chief of the <i>Indians</i> came to invite us to eat. We
    found Mats laid on the Ground for us to sit on, and all the Village met
    to see us.</p>

  <p>We gave them to understand, that we came from Monsieur <i>de la
    Sale</i>, who had made a Settlement on the Bay of <i>Mexico</i>; that
    we had pass’d thro’ many Nations, which we nam’d, and that we were
    going to <i>Canada</i> for Commodities, and would return down the
    River; that we would bring Men<span class="sidenote">Kind <em>Indians</em>.</span>
    to defend them against their Enemies
    and then settle among them; that the Nations we had pass’d through had
    appointed Men to guide us, and we desired the same Favour of them, with
    some Canoes and Provisions, and that we would reward our Guides and pay
    for what they furnish’d us.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span></p>

  <p>The Conveniency of an Interpreter, we then had, gave us the Opportunity
    of making ourselves be easily understood, and the Chief answer’d to our
    Proposals, that he would send Men to the other Villages to acquaint
    them with our Demands, and to consult with them what was to be done
    in that Case; that as for the rest, they were amaz’d at our having
    pass’d thro’ so many Nations, without having been detain’d, or kill’d,
    considering what a small Number we were.</p>

  <p>When the Discourse was ended, that Chief caus’d Meat to be set before
    us, as dry’d Flesh, Bread made of <i>Indian</i> Corn of several Sorts,
    and Water Melons; after which he made us smoke, and then we return’d
    to our House, where being eas’d of all those Impediments, we gave each
    other an Account of our Affairs, at Leisure, and were inform’d, that
    those People impatiently expected<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> the Return of Monsieur <i>de la
    Sale</i>, which confirm’d us in the Resolution of concealing his Death.
    We observ’d the Situation of that Post, and were made acquainted with
    the Nature of the Country and the Manners of those People, of which I
    shall give the following Remarks.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote"><em>French</em> House among the <em>Acconcea’s</em> describ’d.</span>
    The House we were then in, was built of Pieces of Cedar laid one upon
    another, and rounded away at the Corners; its roof is of bark. It is
    seated on a small Eminency, half a Musket-shot from the Village, in a
    Country abounding in all Things. The Plains lying on one Side of it,
    are stor’d with Beeves, wild Goats, Deer, Turkeys, Bustards, Swans,
    Ducks, Teal and other Game.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Product of the Country.</span>
    The Trees produce plenty of Fruit, and very good, as Peaches, Plumbs,
    Mulberries, Grapes, and Wallnuts. They have a Sort of Fruit they call
    <i>Piaguimina</i>, not unlike our Medlars, but much better and more
    delicious. Such as live near the Rivers, as that House is, do not want
    for Fish of all Sorts, and they have <i>Indian</i> Wheat, whereof they
    make good Bread. There are also fine Plains diversify’d with several
    Sorts of Trees, as I have said before.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

  <p>The Nation of the <i>Accancea’s</i> consists of four Villages.
    The first is call’d <i>Otsotchove</i>,<span class="sidenote">Nation
    of the <em>Accancea’s</em>.</span> near which we were; the
    second <i>Toriman</i>, both of them seated on the River; the third
    <i>Tonginga</i>; and the fourth <i>Cappa</i>, on the Bank of the
    <i>Missisipi</i>. These Villages are built after a different Manner
    from the others we had seen before, in this Point, that the Cottages,
    which are alike as to their Materials and Rounding at the Top, are
    long, and cover’d with the Bark of Trees, and so very large, that
    several of them can hold two hundred Persons, belonging to several
    Families.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Household Stuff.</span>
    The people are not so neat as the <i>Cenis</i>, or the <i>Assonis</i>
    in their Houses, for some of them lie on the Ground, without any Thing
    under them but some Mats, or a dress’d Hide. However, some of them
    have more Conveniencies, but the Generality has not.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> All their
    Moveables consist in some Earthen Vessels and oval wooden Platters,
    which are neatly made, and with which they drive a Trade.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Shape.</span>
    They are generally very well shap’d and active; the Women are handsome,
    or at least have a much better Presence than those of the other
    Villages we pass’d thro’ before. They make Canoes all of one Piece,
    which are well wrought. As for themselves they are very faithful, good
    natur’d, and Warriors like the rest.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">The Ceremony of the Pipe perform’d to M. <em>Cavelier</em>.</span>
    The 25th, the Elders being assembled, came to see us, and told the
    Sieur <i>Couture</i>, that they design’d to sing and dance the
    <i>Calumet</i>, or Pipe; because the others had sung it, some of them
    to the late Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, and the rest to Monsieur
    <i>Tonty</i>, and therefore it was but reasonable they should do the
    same to get a Firelock, as well as the others. Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i>
    was inform’d of it, and it was requisite to consent to it, to please
    those <i>Indians</i>, because we stood in need of them.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Ceremony of the Pipe.</span>
    The Ceremony began with Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i>, who was led under
    the Arms and seated on a Hide, without the Cottage. The Forks, the
    Skins laid on it in Honour of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>Pipe, the Singing as loud as they
    cou’d roar, both by Men and Women, and all the other Ceremonies
    were observ’d, as I have mention’d them before; so that Monsieur
    <i>Cavelier</i> being weary of them, he caus’d the Chief to be told,
    that he was out of Order, and desir’d his Nephew might be put in his
    Place, which was done accordingly, and they spent the whole Night in
    Singing. In the Morning they perform’d some other Ceremonies, not worth
    relating.</p>

  <p>The Solemnity being ended, by every Man’s smoking of the Pipe, the
    <i>Indians</i> took it, with some Bullocks Hides, and Goats and Otters
    Skins, and a Collar made of Shells, all which they carry’d to our
    House, and we gave them a Firelock, two Axes, six Knives, one hundred
    Charges of Powder, as much Ball, and some Strings of Beads for their
    Wives. The Chief having given Notice of our coming to the other
    Villages, their Deputies came to see us; we entertain’d them in the
    House, and propos’d to them our Designs, as had been done to the Chief.
    They stood considering a While, then held a Sort of Consultation among
    themselves, which held not long without talking, and then agreed to
    grant us what we ask’d, which was a Canoe and a Man of each Village to
    conduct us, upon the promis’d Consideration, and so they went away to
    the Cottage of the Chief of the Village.</p>

  <p>The 27th, the Chief and the Elders met again to consult about what we
    demanded of them; the Length of the Journey made them apprehensive for
    those, who were to conduct us; but, at Length, we having dispell’d
    their Fears by our Arguments, and they having again deliberated some
    Time, agreed to our Request. We again made them a Present, promising a
    good Reward to our Guides, and so we prepar’d to set forwards. Little
    <i>Bartholomew</i> the <i>Parisian</i>, having intimated to us, that
    he would willingly stay in that House, because he was none of the
    ablest of Body, we recommended him to the Sieur <i>Couture</i>. We
    desir’d those that remain’d there, to keep the Secret of Monsr. <i>de
      la Sale’s</i> Death, promis’d to send them Relief,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span> left them our
    Horses, which were of great Use to go a Hunting, and gave them fifteen
    or sixteen Pounds of Powder, eight hundred Balls, three hundred Flints,
    twenty-six Knives, and ten Axes, two or three Pounds Weight of Beads;
    Monsr. <i>Cavelier</i> left them Part of his Linen, hoping we should
    soon be in a Place where we should get more; and all of them having
    made their Peace with God,<span class="sidenote">The Journey continued.</span>
    by Means of the Sacrament of Penance, we took Leave of them,
    excepting the Sieur <i>Couture</i>, who went to conduct us Part of the Way.</p>

  <p>We imbark’d on a Canoe belonging to one of the Chiefs, being at least
    twenty Persons, as well Women as Men, and arriv’d safe, without any
    Trouble, at a Village call’d <i>Toriman</i>,<span class="sidenote"><em>Toriman</em>
    Village.</span> for we were going down the
    River. We were well received in the Chief’s wigwam, and were treated as
    we had been when among the others. We propos’d it to these People, or
    rather demanded it of them to confirm what had been granted us by the
    others, and they deferr’d giving us their Answer till the next Day; for
    they do Nothing without consulting about it, and we having brought a
    Sack of <i>Indian</i> Wheat, from the <i>French</i> Mens House, desir’d
    the Chief to cause Women to pound it, for which we would give ’em
    Something. Immediately he made a Sign to his Officers to go call them,
    and they went as readily.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Officers.</span>There were seven or eight of those Officers always about him, stark
    naked and besmear’d, some after one Fashion, and others after another.
    Each of them had three or four Calabashes or Gourds, hanging at a
    Leather Girdle about their Wastes, in which there were several Pebbles,
    and behind them hung a Horse’s Tail, so that when they ran, the Gourds
    made a ratling Noise, and the Tail being born up by the Wind, stood out
    at its full Length, so that Nothing could be seen more ridiculous; but
    it behooved us to take Heed of shewing the least Smile.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">The River <em>Missisipi</em> found at last.</span>
    The remaining Part of the Day was spent in going with the Sieur
    <i>Couture</i> to see the fatal River so much sought after by us,
    called <i>Colbert</i>, when first discover’d, and <i>Missisipi</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
    or, <i>Mechasipi</i> by the Natives that were near us. It is a very
    fine River and deep, the Breadth of it about a Quarter of a League, and
    the Stream very rapid. The Sieur <i>Couture</i> assur’d us, that it has
    two Branches or Channels, which parted from each other above us, and
    that we had pass’d its other Branch, when we came to the first Village
    of the <i>Accancea’s</i>, with which Nation we still were.</p>

  <p>The 28th, the Chief and the Elders being assembled, they granted our
    Requests. We were to part, in order to be entertain’d in several
    Places, where we took Notice of some particular Ceremonies,<span class="sidenote">Particular
    Ceremonies.</span> which we
    had not seen among the other Nations. One of them is, that they serve
    up their Meat in two or four large Dishes, which are first set down
    before the two principal Guests, who are at one End, and when they
    have eaten a little, those Dishes are shov’d down lower and others are
    served up in their Place, in the same Manner; so that the first Dishes
    are serv’d at the upper End and thrust down lower as others come in.</p>

  <p>He who treats, does not sit down with the Company, nor does he eat, but
    performs the Part of a Steward, taking Care of the Dressing and of the
    Placing of the Meat serv’d up; and to the End he may appear the finer,
    he never fails to besmear himself with Clay, or some red or black
    Colouring they make use of.</p>

  <p>The 29th, we set out from that Village, and imbark’d on two Canoes to
    cross the <i>Missisipi</i>.<span class="sidenote"><em>Tonningua</em> Village.</span> The Chief and about a Score of young Folks
    bore us Company to the next Village call’d <i>Tonningua</i>, seated on
    the Bank of that River, where we were receiv’d in the Chief’s Cottage,
    as we had been in the others. The Elders treated us in their Turns, and
    the Descriptions before given will serve for this Place, there being
    but little Difference between them and their Neighbours.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote"><em>Cappa</em> Village.</span>
    The 30th, we set out for <i>Cappa</i>, the last Village of the
    <i>Accancea’s</i>, eight Leagues distant from the Place we had left.
    We were obliged to cross the River <i>Missisipi</i> several Times in
    this Way; because it winds very much, and we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span> had some foul Weather,
    which made it late before we could reach <i>Cappa</i>. A great Number
    of Youth came to meet us, some of them conducted us to the Chief’s
    Cottage, and others took Care of our Baggage, which was restor’d to
    us very honestly. We found the Elders waiting for us; a great Fire
    was kindled to dry us, and the Cottage was lighted by several burning
    Reeds,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> which they make use of instead of Flambeaus; after which we
    were serv’d as in other Places.</p>

  <p>The 31st, we receiv’d Visits from the Elders. Their Discourse ran upon
    the War they design’d to make, thinking to ingage us in it, and we
    return’d the same Answer as we had done to the others, that we would
    soon return with all Things we stood in Need of. We ask’d a Man of
    them, which was granted, and the Day ended in Feasting.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Aug. 1687</span>
    <span class="sidenote">Entertainment given by the Indians.</span>
    We would willingly have set out the First of <i>August</i>; but the
    Chief came and told us, it could not be, because the Women had not
    pounded our Corn, which however was done; but they made use of that
    Pretence to oblige us to stay, and to have Leisure to give us some
    Diversion, after their Manner. Accordingly, about Ten in the Morning,
    the Warriors and Youth came together to Dance. They were dress’d after
    their best Manner, some of them wearing Plumes of several Colours,
    wherewith they adorn their Heads, others, instead of Feathers, had two
    Bullocks Horns, and were all besmear’d with Clay, of Black or of Red,
    so that they really look’d like a Company of Devils or Monsters, and
    in those Figures they danc’d, as I have describ’d it, speaking of the
    other Nations.</p>

  <p>The Second, we made ready to be going. The <i>Indian</i> given by
    the first Village for our Guide, would not go any farther. A Man,
    said to be an Hermaphrodite, offer’d to supply his Place, saying, he
    was willing to go to the <i>Islinois</i>. We took Leave of the Sieur
    <i>Couture</i>, to whom Monsr. <i>Cavelier</i> made an Exhortation,
    encouraging him to persevere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span> and have Patience, in Hopes of the
    Relief we wou’d send him, and so we imbark’d on the <i>Missisipi</i>
    in a Canoe, being Nine in Number, that is, five of us, and the four
    <i>Indians</i> that were our Guides. We were oblig’d to cross that
    River very often, and no less frequently to carry our Canoe and Goods,
    as well on Account of the Rapidity of the River, and to find it slacker
    on the one or the other Side of it, which was very troublesome to our
    Guides, as because of the little islands we met with, which are form’d
    by the impetuous beating of the Water upon the Banks, that oppose its
    Course, where the Channels happen not to lie strait; there it washes
    away the Earth and bears down great Trees, which in Process of Time
    form little Islands, that divide the Channel. At Night we incamp’d in
    one of those small Islands, for our greater Safety, for we were then
    come into an Enemy’s Nation, call’d <i>Machigamea</i>,<span class="sidenote"><em>Machigamea</em>
    Nation.</span> which put our <i>Indians</i> into great Frights.</p>

  <p>It is certain our Toil was very great, for we were oblig’d to row in
    the Canoe, to help our <i>Indians</i> to stem the Current of the River,
    because we were going up, and it was very strong and rapid; we were
    often necessitated to land, and sometimes to travel over miry Lands,
    where we sunk up half way the Leg; other Times over burning Sands,
    which scorch’d our Feet, having no Shoes, or else over Splinters of
    Wood, which ran into the Soles of our Feet, and when we were come to
    the resting Place, we were to provide Fuel to dress our Meat, and
    provide all Things for our <i>Indians</i>, who would not have done so
    much as go fetch a Cup of Water, tho’ we were on the Bank of the River,
    and yet we were happy enough in having them.</p>

  <p>We proceeded on, continually undergoing the same Toil, till the
    Seventh, when, we saw the first Bullock, we had met on our Way,
    since our coming among the <i>Accancea’s</i>. The <i>Indians</i>,
    who had a great Mind to eat Flesh, made a Sign to me, to go kill
    it. I pursu’d and Shot, but it did not fall, the <i>Indians</i> ran
    after, kill’d, and came to tell us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span> it must be parch’d, or dry’d,
    which was accordingly done. I must here take Notice of a Ceremony our
    <i>Indians</i> perform’d, when they came near the Bullock, before they
    flead him.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Ceremony at dressing a Bullock.</span>
    In the first Place, they adorn’d his Head with some Swans and Bustards
    Down, dy’d red, and put some Tabacco into his Nostrils, and between
    the Clefts of the Hoofs. When they had flead him, they cut out the
    Tongue, and put a Bit of Tabacco into its Place; then they stuck two
    Wooden Forks into the Ground, laid a Stick across them, on which they
    plac’d several Slices of the Flesh, in the Nature of an Offering. The
    Ceremony being ended, we parch’d or dry’d the best Parts of the Beast
    and proceeded on our Journey.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Banks of several Colours.</span>
    The 9th, we found the Banks of the River very high, and the Earth of
    them Yellow, Red and White, and thither the Natives came to furnish
    themselves with it, to adorn their Bodies, on Festival Days. We held
    on our Way till the 14th, when we met a Herd of Bullocks, whereof we
    kill’d five, dry’d Part of them, and proceeded till the 18th.</p>

  <p>The 19th, we came to the Mouth of the River,<span class="sidenote"><em>Houabache</em>
    River.</span> call’d <i>Houabache</i>,
    said to come from the Country of the <i>Iroquois</i>, towards <i>New
    England</i>. That is a very fine River, its Water extraordinary clear,
    and the Current of it, gentle. Our <i>Indians</i> offer’d up to it,
    by Way of Sacrifice, some Tabacco and Beef Steaks, which they fix’d
    on Forks, and left them on the Bank, to be dispos’d of as the River
    thought fit. We observ’d some other Superstitions among those poor
    People, one whereof was as follows.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Indian Fast.</span>
    There were some certain Days, on which they Fasted, and we knew them,
    when as soon as they awak’d, they besmear’d their Faces and Arms, or
    other Parts of their Bodies, with a slimy Sort of Earth, or pounded
    Charcoal; for that Day they did not eat till Ten or Eleven of the Clock
    at Night, and before they did eat they were to wipe off that Smearing,
    and had Water brought them for that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span> Purpose. The Occasion of their
    Fasting was, as they gave us to understand, that they might have good
    Success in Hunting, and kill Abundance of Bullocks.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Salt Water Spring.</span>
    We held on our Way till the 25th, when the <i>Indians</i> shew’d us a
    Spring of Salt Water, within a Musket Shot of us, and made us go ashore
    to view it. We observ’d the Ground about it was much beaten by Bullocks
    Feet, and it is likely they love that Salt Water. The Country about,
    was full of Hillocks, cover’d with Oaks and Wallnut-Trees, Abundance
    of Plum-Trees, almost all the Plums red and pretty good, besides great
    Store of other Sorts of Fruits,<span class="sidenote">Wild Fruit.</span>
    whose Names we know not, and among
    them one shap’d like a midling Pear, with Stones in it as big as large
    Beans. When ripe it peels like a Peach, the Taste is indifferent good,
    but rather of the Sweetest.</p>

  <p>The 27th, having discover’d a Herd of Beeves, we went ashore to kill
    some; I shot a Heifer, which was very good Meat, we put a Board the
    best of it, and held on our Way till the Evening, when we encamp’d on
    an Island, where we observ’d an alteration in the Humour and Behaviour
    of our <i>Indians</i>. This put us under some Apprehension, and the
    more, for that he who was reckon’d an Hermaphrodite, told us, they
    intended to leave us, which oblig’d us to secure our Arms and double
    our Watch during the Night, for Fear they should forsake us.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">7 Sept. 1687</span>
    With that Jealousy we proceeded on our Journey the 28th and 29th,
    coasting along the Foot of an upright Rock, about sixty, or eighty
    Foot high, round which the River glides. Held on the 30th and 31st,
    and the first of <i>September</i> pass’d by the Mouth of a River
    <span class="sidenote"><em>Missouris</em> River.</span>
    call’d <i>Missouris</i>, whose Water is always thick, and to which our
    <i>Indians</i> did not forget to offer Sacrifice.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Figure of a pretended Monster.</span>
    The 2d, we arriv’d at the Place, where the Figure is of the pretended
    Monster spoken of by Father <i>Marquet</i>. That Monster consists of
    two scurvy Figures drawn in red, on the flat Side of a Rock, about
    eight or ten Foot high, which wants very much of the extraordinary
    Height that Relation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span> mentions. However our <i>Indians</i> paid Homage,
    by offering Sacrifice to that Stone; tho’ we endeavour’d to give them
    to understand, that the said Rock had no Manner of Virtue, and that
    we worship’d something above it, pointing up to Heaven; but it was to
    no Purpose, and they made Signs to us, that they should die if they
    did not perform that Duty. We proceeded, coasting along a Chain of
    Mountains, and at length, on the 3d, left the <i>Missisipi</i>,
    <span class="sidenote">River of the <em>Islinois</em>.</span> to
    enter the River of the <i>Islinois</i>.</p>

  <p>We found a great Alteration in that River, as well with Respect to its
    Course, which is very gentle, as to the Country about it, which is much
    more agreeable and beautiful than that about the great River, by Reason
    of the many fine Woods and Variety of Fruit its Banks are adorn’d with.
    It was a very great comfort to us, to find so much Ease in going up
    that River, by Reason of its gentle Stream, so that we all stay’d in
    the Canoe and made much more Way.</p>

  <p>Thus we went on till the 8th, without stopping any longer than to kill
    a Bullock, and one of our <i>Indians</i>,<span class="sidenote"><em>Indian</em>
    dies of eating raw Suet.</span> who had a craving Stomach,
    having eaten some of its Suet hot and raw, was taken very ill, and died
    of it, as I shall mention in its Place.</p>

  <p>The 9th, we came into a Lake, about half a League over, which we
    cross’d, and return’d into the Channel of the River, on the Banks
    whereof we found several Marks of the Natives having been incamp’d
    there, when they came to fish and dry what they caught. The 10th, we
    cross’d another Lake, call’d <i>Primitehouy</i>, return’d to the River,
    and the 11th, saw <i>Indians</i> before us, incamp’d on the Bank of a
    River, whereupon we stop’d and made ready our Arms. In the mean Time,
    one of them came towards us by Land, and we put on our Canoe towards him.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Meeting with <em>Islinois</em>.</span>
    When that <i>Indian</i> was near, he stood gazing on us, without
    speaking a Word, and then drawing still nearer, we gave him to
    understand, that we were sent by Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, and came
    from him. Then he made Signs to us, to advance towards his People,
    whom, he went before to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span> acquaint with what he had said to him, so that
    when we were come near them they fired Several Shot to salute us, and
    we answer’d them with our Firelocks.</p>

  <p>After that mutual Salutation, they came into our Canoe, to signify,
    they were glad to hear News of Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>. We
    ask’d them, What Nation they were of; they answer’d, They were
    <i>Islinois</i>, of a Canton call’d <i>Cascasquia</i>. We enquir’d
    whether Monsieur <i>Tonty</i> was at Fort <i>Lewis</i>; they gave us to
    understand, that he was not, but that he was gone to the War against
    the <i>Iroquois</i>. They invited us Ashore, to go with them to eat of
    such as they had, we thank’d them, and they brought us some Gourds and
    Water Melons, in Exchange for which, we gave them some parch’d Flesh.</p>

  <p>We had not by the Way taken Notice of a Canoe, in which was a Man
    with two Women, who, being afraid of us, had hid themselves among the
    Reeds, but that man seeing us stop among his Countrymen, took Heart,
    came to us, and having told us, that he belong’d to a Village near Fort
    <i>Lewis</i>, we set out together, and one of our <i>Indians</i> went
    into that Canoe, to help them to shove, so they call the Way of pushing
    on the Canoe with Poles instead of rowing.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Fort <em>Lewis</em> among the <em>Islinois</em>.</span>
    On <i>Sunday</i>, the 14th of <i>September</i>, about two in the
    Afternoon, we came into the Neighbourhood of Fort <i>Lewis</i>. Drawing
    near, we were met by some <i>Indians</i> that were on the Bank, who
    having view’d us well, and understanding we came from Monsr. <i>de
    la Sale</i>, and that we belong’d to him, ran to the Fort to carry
    the News, and immediately we saw a <i>French</i> Man come out, with a
    Company of <i>Indians</i>, who fir’d a Volley of several Pieces, to
    salute us. Then the <i>French</i> Man drew near, and desir’d us to come
    Ashore, which we did, leaving only one in the Canoe, to take Care of
    our Baggage; for the <i>Islinois</i> are very sharp at carrying off
    anything they can lay their Hands on, and consequently, nothing near so
    honest as the Nations we had pass’d thro’.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Arrival at Fort <em>Lewis</em>.</span>
    We all walk’d together towards the Fort, and found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span> three <i>French</i>
    Men coming to meet us, and among them a Clerk, who had belong’d to the
    late Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i>, nomme Boisrondet. They immediately ask’d
    us, where Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i> was, we told them, he had brought us
    Part of the Way, and left us at a Place about forty Leagues beyond the
    <i>Cenis</i>, and that he was then in good Health. All that was true
    enough; for Monsr. <i>Cavelier</i> and I, who were the Persons, that
    then spoke, were not present at Monsr. <i>de la Sale’s</i> Death; he
    was in good Health when he left us, and I have told the Reasons we had
    for concealing his Death, till we came into <i>France</i>.</p>

  <p>It is no less true, that Father <i>Anastasius</i>, and he they call’d
    <i>Teissier</i>, could have given a better Account, the one as an Eye
    Witness, and the other, as one of the Murderers, and they were both
    with us; but to avoid lying, they said Nothing. We farther told them,
    we had Orders to go over into <i>France</i>, to give an Account of the
    Discoveries made by Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>, and to procure the
    sending of Succours.</p>

  <p>At length, we enter’d the Fort, where we found and surpriz’d several
    Persons who did not expect us. All the <i>French</i> were under Arms
    and made several Discharges to welcome us.<span class="sidenote">Reception.</span>
    Monsieur <i>de Belle Fontaine</i> Lieutenant to Monsr. <i>Tonty</i>, was at the Head of
    them and complimented us. Then we were conducted to the Chappel, where
    we return’d Thanks to God, from the Bottom of our Hearts, for having
    preserv’d and conducted us in Safety; after which we had our Lodgings
    assigned us, Monsr. <i>Cavelier</i> and Father <i>Anastasius</i> had
    one Chamber, and we were put into the Magazine, or Warehouse. All this
    While, the Natives came by Intervals, to fire their Pieces, to express
    their Joy for our Return, and for the News we brought of Monsieur <i>de
    la Sale</i>, which refresh’d our Sorrow for his Misfortune; perceiving
    that his Presence would have settled all Things advantageously.</p>

  <p>The Day after our Arrival, one of the <i>Indians</i>, who had conducted
    us, having been sick ever since he eat the raw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span> Beef Suet, I mention’d
    before, died, and his Companions took away and bury’d him privately. We
    gave them the promis’d Reward, and the Part belonging to the Dead Man,
    to be deliver’d to his Relations. They stay’d some Time in the Fort,
    during the which, we took extraordinary Care of them, and at last they
    return’d to their own Homes.</p>

  <p>As far as we could gather by half Words dropp’d there by one or
    other at the Fort, Something had been done there prejudicial to the
    Service of Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i>, and against his Authority, and
    therefore some dreaded his Return, but more especially a <i>Jesuit</i>
    was in great Consternation. He was sick, Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i>,
    Father <i>Anastasius</i> and I went to visit him. He enquired very
    particularly of all Points, and could not conceal his Trouble, which we
    would not seem to take Notice of.</p>

  <p>Our Design being to make the best of our way to <i>Canada</i>, in Order
    to set out Aboard the first <i>French</i> Ships that should Sail for
    <i>France</i>, we enquired how we were to proceed, and met with several
    Difficulties. The Navigation on that<span class="sidenote">Falls in
    the River.</span> River was very Dangerous,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> by
    Reason of the Falls there are in it, which must be carefully avoided,
    unless a Man will run an inevitable Hazard of perishing. There were
    few Persons capable of managing that Affair, and the War with the
    <i>Iroquois</i> made all Men afraid.</p>

  <p>However the Sieur <i>Boisrondet</i>, Clerk to the late Monsr. <i>de la
    Sale</i>, having told us he had a Canoe, in which he design’d to go
    down to <i>Canada</i>, we prepared to make use of that Opportunity.
    Care was taken to gather Provisions for our Voyage, to get Furs to
    barter as we pass’d by <i>Micilimaquinay</i>. The Visits of two
    Chiefs of Nations, call’d <i>Cascasquia</i> <i>Peroueria</i> and
    <i>Cacahouanous</i> discover’d by the late Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>,
    did not interrupt our Affairs, and all things being ready on the 1st,
    we took Leave on the 18th, of those we left in the Fort. Monsieur
    <i>Cavelier</i> writ a Letter for Monsieur <i>Tonty</i>, which he left
    there <span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>to be delivered to him, and we repair’d to the Lake to imbark.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Oct. 1687</span>
    It would be needless to relate all the Troubles and Hardships we met
    with, in that Journey, it was painful and fruitless, for having gone
    to the Bank of the Lake, in very foul Weather, after waiting there
    eight Days, for that foul Weather to cease, and after we had imbark’d,
    <span class="sidenote">M. <em>Cavelier</em>, &amp;c. set out and returns again.</span>
    notwithstanding the Storm, we were oblig’d to put Ashore again, to
    return to the Place where we had imbark’d, and there to dig a Hole in
    the Earth, to bury our Baggage and Provisions, to save the Trouble
    of carrying them back to Fort <i>Lewis</i>, whither we return’d and
    arrived there the 7th of <i>October</i>; where they were surpriz’d to
    see us come back.</p>

  <p>Thus were we oblig’d to continue in that Fort all the rest of
    <i>Autumn</i> and Part of the <i>Winter</i>, to our great Sorrow, and
    not so much for our own Disappointment, as for being, by that Means,
    obstructed from sending of Succours, as soon as we had expected, as
    well to the said Fort, as to those <i>French</i> of our own Company,
    whom we had left on the Coast of the Bay of <i>Mexico</i>.</p>

  <p>It was then the good Season for shooting. Those Gentlemen at the Fort
    had secur’d two good <i>Indian</i> Sportsmen, who never let us want for
    Wild Fowl of all Sorts; besides we had good Bread, and as good Fruit,
    and had there been any Thing to drink besides Water, we had far’d well.
    The Leisure we had during our Stay there, gave me an Opportunity of
    making the following Remarks, as well of my own Observation, as what I
    learn’d of the <i>French</i> residing there.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Description of Fort <em>Lewis</em> and the Country about
    it.</span>Fort <i>Lewis</i> is in the Country of the <i>Islinois</i> and seated
    on a steep Rock, about two hundred Foot high, the River running at
    the Bottom of it. It is only fortified with Stakes and Palisades, and
    some Houses advancing to the Edge of the Rock. It has a very spacious
    Esplanade, or Place of Arms. The Place is naturally strong, and might
    be made so by Art, with little Expence. Several of the Natives live in
    it, in their Huts. I cannot give an Account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span> of the Latitude it stands
    in, for Want of proper Instruments to take an Observation, but Nothing
    can be pleasanter; and it may be truly affirm’d, that the Country of
    the <i>Islinois</i> enjoys all that can make it accomplish’d, not only
    as to Ornament, but also for its plentiful Production of all Things
    requisite for the Support of human Life.</p>

  <p>The Plain, which is water’d by the River, is beautified by two small
    Hills, about half a League distant from the Fort, and those Hills are
    cover’d with Groves of Oaks, Walnut-Trees and other Sorts I have named
    elsewhere. The Fields are full of Grass, growing up very high. On the
    Sides of the Hills is found  <span class="sidenote">Lime and Clay for Bricks, &amp;c.</span>
    a gravelly Sort of Stone, very fit to make
    Lime for Building. There are also many Clay Pits, fit for making of
    Earthen Ware, Bricks and Tiles, and along the River there are Coal
    Pits, the Coal whereof has been try’d and found very good.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Mines.</span>There is no Reason to question, but that there are in this Country,
    Mines of all Sorts of Metals, and of the richest, the Climate being
    the same as that of <i>New Mexico</i>. We saw several Spots, where it
    appeared there were Iron Mines, and found some Pieces of it on the Bank
    of the River, which Nature had cleansed. Travellers who have been at
    the upper Part of the <i>Missisipi</i>, affirm that they have found
    Mines there, of very good Lead.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Product.</span>
    That Country is one of the most temperate in the World, and
    consequently whatsoever is sow’d there, whether Herbs, Roots,
    <i>Indian</i> and even <i>European</i> Corn thrives very well, as has
    been try’d by the Sieur <i>Boisrondet</i>, who sow’d of all Sorts,
    and had a plentiful Crop, and we eat of the Bread, which was very
    good. And whereas we were assured, that there were Vines which run up,
    whose Grapes are very good and delicious, growing along the River,
    it is reasonable to believe, that if those Vines were transplanted
    and prun’d, there might be very good Wine made of them. There is also
    Plenty of wild Apple and Pear Trees, and of several other Sorts, which
    would afford excellent Fruit, were they grafted and transplanted.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

  <p>All other Sorts of Fruit, as Plumbs, Peaches and others, wherewith the
    Country abounds, would become exquisite, if the same Industry were
    us’d, and other Sorts of Fruit we have in <i>France</i> would thrive
    well, if they were carry’d over. The Earth produces a Sort of Hemp,
    whereof Cloth might be made and Cordage.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Manners and Customs of the <em>Islinois</em>.</span>
    As for the Manners and Customs of the <i>Islinois</i>, in many
    Particulars they are the same as those of the other Nations we have
    seen. They are naturally fierce and revengeful, and among them the Toil
    of Sowing, Planting, carrying of Burdens,<span class="sidenote">Women
    do all Labour.</span> and doing all other Things
    that belong to the Support of Life, appertains peculiarly to the Women.
    The Men have no other Business but going to the War and hunting, and
    the women must fetch the Game when they have kill’d it, which sometimes
    they are to carry very far to their Dwellings, and there to parch, or
    dress it any other Way.</p>

  <p>When the Corn or other Grain is sow’d, the Women secure it from the
    Birds till it comes up. Those Birds are a sort of Starlings, like ours
    in <i>France</i>, but larger and fly in great Swarms.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Children.</span>The
    <i>Islinois</i> have but few Children, and are extremely fond of
    them; it is the Custom among them, as well as others I have mentioned,
    never to chide, or beat them, but only to throw Water at them, by Way
    of Chastisement.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Thieving.</span>The
    Nations we have spoken of before, are not at all, or very little,
    addicted to Thieving; but it is not so with the <i>Islinois</i>, and
    it behoves every Man to watch their Feet as well as their Hands, for
    they know how to turn any Thing out of the Way most dexterously. They
    are subject to the general Vice of all the other <i>Indians</i>, which
    is to boast <span class="sidenote">Boasting.</span> very much
    of their Warlike Exploits, and that is the main
    Subject of their Discourse, and they are very great Lyars.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Care of the Dead.</span>
    They pay a Respect to their Dead, as appears by their special Care
    of burying them, and even of putting into Coffins placed high above
    the ground, the Bodies of such as are considerable among them,
    as their Chiefs and others,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span> which is also practiced among the
    <i>Accancea’s</i>, but they differ in this Particular, that the
    <i>Accancea’s</i> weep and make their Complaints for some Days, whereas
    the <i>Chahouanous</i> and other People of the <i>Islinois</i> Nation
    do just the Contrary; for when any of them die, they wrap them up in
    Skins, and then put them into Coffins made of the Barks of Trees,
    then sing and dance about them for twenty four Hours. Those Dancers
    take Care to tie Calabashes, or Gourds about their Bodies, with some
    <i>Indian</i> Wheat in them, to rattle and make a Noise, and some of
    them have a Drum, made of a great Earthen Pot, on which they extend a
    wild Goat’s Skin, and beat thereon with one Stick, like our Tabors.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Presents to the Dead.</span>
    During that Rejoicing, they throw their Presents on the Coffin, as
    Bracelets, Pendants, or Pieces of Earthen Ware, and Strings of Beads,
    encouraging the Singers to perform their Duty well. If any Friend
    happens to come thither at that Time, he immediately throws down his
    Present and falls a singing and dancing like the rest. When that
    Ceremony is over, they bury the Body, with Part of the Presents, making
    choice of such as may be most proper for it. They also bury with it,
    some Store of <i>Indian</i> Wheat, with a Pot to boil it in, for fear
    the dead Person should be hungry on his long Journey; and they repeat
    the same Ceremony at the Year’s End.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Game of the Stick.</span>
    A good Number of Presents still remaining, they divide them into
    several Lots, and play at a Game, call’d of the Stick, to give them to
    the Winner. That Game is play’d, taking a short Stick, very smooth and
    greas’d, that it may be the Harder to hold it fast. One of the Elders
    throws that Stick as far as he can, the young Men run after it, snatch
    it from each other, and at last, he who remains possess’d of it, has
    the first Lot. The Stick is then thrown again, he who keeps it then
    has the second Lot, and so on to the End. The Women, whose Husbands
    have been slain in War, often perform the same Ceremony, and treat the
    Singers and Dancers whom they have before invited.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Marriages.</span>
    The Marriages of the <i>Islinois</i> last no longer, than the Parties
    agree together; for they freely part after a Hunting Bout, each going
    which Way they please, without any Ceremony. However, the Men are
    jealous enough of their Wives, and when they catch them in a Fault,
    they generally cut off their Noses, and I saw one who had been so
    serv’d.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Adultery.</span>
    Nevertheless, Adultery is not reckon’d any great Crime among them,
    and there are Women who make no Secret of having had to do with
    <i>French</i> Men. Yet are they not sufficiently addicted to that Vice
    to offer themselves, and they never fall, unless they are sued to,
    when, they are none of the most difficult in the World to be prevail’d
    on. The rest I leave to those who have liv’d longer there than I.</p>

  <p>We continu’d some Time in Fort <i>Lewis</i>, without receiving any
    News. Our Business was, after having heard Mass, which we had the good
    Fortune to do every Day, to divert our selves the best we could.<span class="sidenote">How
    the Travellers liv’d.</span> The
    <i>Indian</i> Women daily brought in something fresh, we wanted not for
    Water Melons, Bread made of <i>Indian</i> Corn, bak’d in the Embers,
    and other such Things, and we rewarded them with little Presents in Return.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">M. <em>Tonty</em> comes to Fort <em>Lewis</em>.</span>
    On the 27th of <i>October</i>, of the same Year, Monsieur <i>Tonty</i>
    return’d from the War with the <i>Iroquois</i>.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Our Embraces
    and the Relation of our Adventures were again repeated; but still
    concealing from him, the Death of Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i>. He told
    us all the Particulars of that war, and said,<span class="sidenote">War
    with the <em>Iroquois</em>.</span> That the <i>Iroquois</i>
    having got Intelligence of the March of the <i>French</i> Forces and
    their Allies, had all come out of their Villages and laid themselves in
    Ambush by the Way; but that having made a sudden and general Discharge
    upon our Men, with their usual Cries, yet without much Harm done, they
    had been repuls’d with Loss, took their Flight, and by the Way burnt
    all their own <span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>Villages. That Monsieur <i>d’Hennonville</i><a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> chief
    Governor of <i>New France</i>, had caus’d the Army to march, to burn
    the rest of their Villages, set Fire to their Country and Corn, but
    would not proceed any farther. That afterwards he had made himself
    Master of several Canoes belonging to the <i>English</i>, most of them
    laden with Brandy, which had been plunder’d; that the <i>English</i>
    had been sent Prisoners to <i>Montreal</i>, they being come to make
    some Attempt upon the <i>Islinois</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Dec. 1687</span>
    We continued after this Manner, till the Month of <i>December</i>,
    when two Men arrived, from <i>Montreal</i>. They came to give Notice
    to Monsr. <i>Tonty</i>, that three Canoes, laden with Merchandize,
    Powder, Ball and other Things, were arriv’d at <i>Chicagou</i>, that
    there being two little Water in the River, and what there was being
    frozen, they could come down no lower; so that it being requisite to
    send Men to fetch those Things, Monsr. <i>Tonty</i> desir’d the Chief
    of the <i>Chahouanous</i> to furnish him with People. That Chief
    accordingly provided forty, as well Men as Women, who set out with some
    <i>French</i> Men. The Honesty of the <i>Chahouanous</i> was the Reason
    of preferring them before the <i>Islinois</i>, who are naturally Knaves.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Feb. 1688</span>
    That Ammunition and the Merchandize were soon brought, and very
    seasonably, the Fort being then in Want. We stay’d there till the
    End of <i>February</i>, 1688, at which Time we fix’d our Resolution
    to depart, tho’ we had no News from <i>Canada</i>, as we expected.
    We found there were some Canoes ready to undertake that Voyage,
    and we laid hold of that Opportunity to convoy each other to the
    <i>Micilimaquinay</i>, where we hop’d to meet some News from
    <i>Canada</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Mar. 1688</span>
    Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> the Priest, had taken Care, before the Death
    of M. <i>de la Sale</i>, his Brother, to get of him a Letter of
    Credit, to receive either a Sum of Money or Furs in the Country of
    the <i>Islinois</i>. He tender’d that Letter to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>M. <i>Tonty</i>, who
    believing M. <i>de la Sale</i> was still alive, made no Difficulty
    of giving him to the Value of about 4000 Livres in Furs, Castors and
    Otter Skins, a Canoe and other Effects, for which, the said Monsr.
    <i>Cavelier</i> gave him his Note,<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and we prepar’d for our Journey.</p>

  <p>I have before observed, that there was a <i>Jesuit</i>, whose name
    was <i>Dalouez</i><a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> at Fort <i>Lewis</i>, and who had been very
    much surpriz’d to hear that Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i> was to come in a
    short Time, being under great Apprehensions on Account of a Conspiracy
    intended to have been carry’d on, against Monsr. <i>de la Sale’s</i>
    Interest. That Father perceiving our Departure was fix’d, mov’d first,
    and went away foremost, to return to <i>Micilimaquinay</i>;<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> so
    that they were left without a Priest at Fort <i>Lewis</i>, which was a
    great Trouble to us, because we were the Occasion of it, and therefore
    those, who were to remain in the Fort, anticipated the Time, and
    made their <i>Easter</i>, taking the Advantage of the Presence of F.
    <i>Anastasius</i> and M. <i>Cavelier</i>.</p>

  <p>At length, we set out the 21st of <i>March</i>, from Fort <i>Lewis</i>.
    <span class="sidenote">The Travel continued.</span>
    The Sieur <i>Boisrondet</i>, who was desirous to return to
    <i>France</i>, join’d us, we imbark’d on the River, which was then
    become navigable, and before we had advanc’d five Leagues, met with a
    rapid Stream, which oblig’d us to go Ashore, and then again into the
    Water, to draw along our Canoe. I had the Misfortune to hurt one of my
    Feet against a Rock that lay under Water, which troubled me very much
    for a long Time; and we being under a Necessity of going often into
    the Water, I suffer’d extreamly, and more than I had done since our
    Departure from the Gulph of <i>Mexico</i>.</p>

  <p>We arriv’d at <i>Chicagou</i> the 29th of <i>March</i>, and our first
    Care was to go seek what we had conceal’d at our former Voyage, having,
    as was there said, bury’d our Luggage and Provisions. We found it had
    been open’d, and some Furs <span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>and Linen taken away, almost all which
    belong’d to me. This had been done by a <i>French</i> Man, whom M.
    <i>Tonty</i> had sent from the Fort, during the Winter Season, to know
    whether there were any Canoes at <i>Chicagou</i>, and whom he had
    directed to see whether any Body had medled with what we had conceal’d,
    and he made Use of that Advice to rob us.</p>

  <p>The bad Weather oblig’d us to stay in that Place, till <i>April</i>.
    That Time of Rest was advantageous for the Healing my Foot; and there
    being but very little Game in that Place, we had Nothing but our
    Meal or <i>Indian</i> Wheat to feed on; yet we discover’d a Kind of
    <i>Manna</i>,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> which was a great Help to us. It was a Sort of
    Trees,<span class="sidenote">Sweet Water from a Tree.</span>
    resembling our Maple, in which we made Incisions, whence flow’d
    a sweet Liquor, and in it we boil’d our <i>Indian</i> Wheat, which made
    it delicious, sweet and of a very agreeable Relish.</p>

  <p>There being no Sugar-Canes in that Country, those Trees supply’d that
    Liquor, which being boil’d up and evaporated, turn’d into a Kind of
    Sugar somewhat brownish, but very good. In the Woods we found a Sort
    of Garlick, not so strong as ours, and small Onions very like ours in
    Taste, and some Charvel<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> of the same Relish as that we have, but
    different in the Leaf.</p>

  <p>The Weather being somewhat mended, we imbark’d again and enter’d upon
    the Lake on the 8th of <i>April</i>, keeping to the North Side to shun
    the <i>Iroquois</i>. We had some Storms also, and saw swelling Waves
    like those of the Sea; but arriv’d safe the 15th at a River call’d
    <i>Quinetanan</i>,<span class="sidenote"><em>Quinetanan</em> River.</span>
    near a Village whence, the Inhabitants depart during
    the Winter Season, to go a Hunting, and reside there all the Summer.</p>

  <p>The Sport is not there as in those Countries from whence we came; but
    on the Contrary, very poor, and we found Nothing but some very lean
    Wild Goats, and even those very rarely, because the Wolves, which are
    very numerous there, make great Havock of them, taking and devouring
    great Numbers after this Manner.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span></p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Apr. 1688</span>
    When the Wolves have discover’d a Herd of Wild Goats,<span class="sidenote">How
    Wolves catch Goats.</span> they rouse and
    set them a running. The Wild Goats never fail to take to the first Lake
    they meet with. The hunting Wolves, who are used to that, guard the
    Banks carefully, moving along the Edges of them. The poor Goats being
    pierc’d by the Cold of the Lake, grow weary and so get out, or else the
    River swelling forces them out with its Waves, quite benumm’d, so that
    they are easily taken by their Enemies, who devour them. We frequently
    saw those Wolves watching along the Side of the Lake, and kept off to
    avoid frightning them, to the End the Wild Goats might not quit their
    Sanctuary, that we might catch some of them, as it sometimes fell out.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote"><em>Poutouatanni</em> Nation.</span>
    The 28th, we arriv’d among the <i>Poutouatannis</i>, which is half
    Way to <i>Micilimaquinay</i>, where we purchas’d some <i>Indian</i>
    Corn for the rest of our Voyage. We left there on the last of the
    month, and we arrived on the 10th of May at the said place of
    <i>Michilimackinac</i>. We found no News there from <i>Montreal</i>,
    and were forc’d to stay some Time to wait an Opportunity to go down
    the River; No Man daring to venture, because of the War with the
    <i>Iroquois</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote"><em>Hurons</em> and <em>Outahouacs</em> Nations.</span>
    There are some <i>French</i> Men in that Place, and four
    <i>Jesuits</i>, who have a House well built with Timber, inclosed
    with Stakes and Palisades. There are also some <i>Hurons</i> and
    <i>Outahouacs</i>, two Neighbouring Nations,<span class="sidenote ul">May
    1688</span> whom those Fathers take
    Care to instruct, not without very much Trouble, those People being
    downright Libertines, and there are very often none but a few Women
    in their Churches. Those Fathers have each of them the Charge of
    instructing a Nation, and to that Effect have translated the Prayers
    into the Language peculiar to each of them, as also all other Things
    relating to the Catholick Faith and Religion.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">June 1688</span>
    They offer’d Father <i>Anastasius</i> and Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i>
    a Room, which they accepted of, and we took up our Lodging in a
    little Hovel some Travellers had made. There we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span> continued the rest
    of <i>May</i> and Part of <i>June</i>, till after the Feast of
    <i>Whitsontide</i>. The Natives of the Country about, till the Land
    and sow <i>Indian</i> Corn, Melons and Gourds, but they do not thrive
    so well as in the Country we came from. However they live on them, and
    besides they have Fish they catch in the Lake, for Flesh is very scarce
    among them.</p>

  <p>On the 4th of <i>June</i>, there arriv’d four Canoes, commanded by
    Monsieur <i>de Porneuf</i>, coming from <i>Montreal</i>, and bringing
    News from the Marques <i>d’Hennonville</i>, and Orders to send to the
    Settlements which were towards the Lake <i>des Puans</i> and others
    higher up, towards the Source of the River <i>Colbert</i>, to know the
    Posture and Condition of Affairs. We prepar’d to be gone with the two
    Canoes. Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> bought another, to carry our Baggage,
    and left Part of his Furs with a Merchant, who gave him a Note to
    receive Money at <i>Montreal</i>. I did the same with those few Furs I
    had, the rest of them having been left at <i>Micilimaquinay</i>.</p>

  <p>We took Leave of the <i>Jesuits</i>, and set out in four Canoes,
    <i>viz.</i> two belonging to Monsieur <i>de Porneuf</i>, and two to
    Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i>, one of which had been brought from Fort
    <i>Lewis</i>, and the other bought, as I have just now said, we being
    twenty-nine of us in those four Canoes. We sail’d on till the 24th,
    when Monsieur <i>de Porneuf</i> left us to go to St. <i>Mary’s</i>
    Fall, to carry the Orders given him. The 25th, we got out of the
    Lake of the <i>Islinois</i>,<span class="sidenote"><em>Islinois</em> and
    <em>Hurons</em>.</span> to enter that of the <i>Hurons</i>, on
    the Banks whereof stands the Village, call’d <i>Tessalon</i>, where
    Monsieur <i>de Porneuf</i> came again to us, the 27th, with a Canoe of
    the Natives, and with him we held on our Way.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">July 1688</span>
    <span class="sidenote"><em>French</em> River.</span>
    We proceeded to <i>Chebonany</i> the 30th of <i>June</i>, and the 3d
    of <i>July</i>, enter’d the <i>French</i> River, where we were forc’d
    several Times to carry our Canoes to avoid the Falls and the rapid
    Streams, observing as we went a barren and dry Country, full of Rocks,
    on which there grow Cedars and Fir Trees, which take Root in the Clefts
    of those Rocks.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span></p>

  <p><span class="sidenote"><em>Nipicingue</em> Lake.</span>
    The 5th, we enter’d upon the little Lake of <i>Nipicingue</i>,
    adjoining to a Nation of that Name. We got out of it again the
    7th, and enter’d upon the great River, where, after having pass’d
    the great Fall, we arriv’d the 13th, at the Point of the Island of
    <i>Montreal</i>. We landed at a Village call’d <i>la Chine</i>,
    which had belong’d to the late Monsr. <i>de la Sale</i>. Monsr.
    <i>Cavelier</i> set out the 14th, for<span class="sidenote">Arrival
    at <em>Montreal</em>.</span> <i>Montreal</i>, where we came to
    him the 17th.</p>

  <p>At <i>Montreal</i> we found the Marques <i>d’ Hennonville</i>, Monsieur
    <i>de Noroy</i> the Intendant and other Gentlemen, to whom we gave
    an Account of our long and painful Travels, with the Particulars of
    what we had seen, which they listned to with Satisfaction, but without
    mentioning Monsieur <i>de la Sale’s</i> Death. We told them the
    Occasion of our going over into <i>France</i>, and they approv’d of it,
    being of Opinion with us, that we ought to hasten our Departure as much
    as possible.</p>

  <p>We made us some Cloaths, whereof we stood in Need. The Sieur
    <i>Teissier</i>, who came along with us, and was of the Reform’d
    Religion, knowing the Exercise of it was forbid in <i>France</i>,
    abjur’d it in the great Church of <i>Montreal</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Arrival at <em>Quebec</em>.</span>
    The 27th, we went aboard a Bark to go down the River to <i>Quebec</i>,
    where we arriv’d the 29th, Father <i>Anastasius</i> carry’d us to the
    Monastery of the Fathers of his Order, seated half a League from the
    Town, on a little River, where we were most kindly receiv’d by the
    Father Guardian and the other Religious Men, who express’d much Joy to
    see us, and we still more for being in a Place of Safety, after so many
    Perils and Toils, for which we return’d our humble Thanks to Almighty
    God, our Protector.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote ul">Aug. 1688</span>
    We chose rather to take up our Lodging there than in the Town, to
    avoid the Visits and troublesome Questions every one would be putting
    to us with much Importunity, which we must have been oblig’d to bear
    patiently. Monsieur <i>Cavelier</i> and his Nephew, whom we had left
    at <i>Montreal</i>, arriv’d some Days after us, and were lodg’d in the
    Seminary.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

  <p>We stay’d in that Monastery till the 21st of <i>August</i>, when we
    imbark’d on a large Boat, eighteen Persons of us, to go down the River
    of St. <i>Lawrence</i>, a Board a Ship, that was taking in and fishing
    of Cod, in order to reach <i>France</i>. We went a Board it the 30th of
    the same Month, and after hearing Mass, made ready and sail’d for our
    dear Country, arriv’d safe at <i>Rochelle</i> on <i>Saturday</i> the
    9th of <i>October</i> 1688, whence, setting out by Land, <i>Friday</i>
    the 15th, the same Providence, which had protected and conducted
    us, brought us without any Misfortune to <i>Roan</i>, the 17th of
    <i>October</i>, the same Year.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THREE <span class="sidenote"><em>Note</em>, That these have writ of those Parts, but none of
    this particular Voyage.</span>several Authors have given an Account of this Voyage;
    <i>First</i>, Father <i>le Clerk</i>, upon the Relations he had from
    the Fathers <i>Zenobius</i> and <i>Anastasius</i>, Recolets, as he
    was himself and both of them Eye-Witnesses: <i>Secondly</i>, The
    Chevalier <i>Tonty</i>, who was also a Witness to a considerable Part
    of those Adventures: And, <i>Lastly</i>, Father <i>Hennepin</i>, a
    <i>Flemming</i>, of the same Order of the Recolets, has done it more
    largely; he seems to be well <span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>acquainted with the Country, and had a
    Share in great Discoveries; but the Truth of his Relations is much
    controverted. It was he who went to the Northward, and towards the
    Source of the <i>Missisipi</i>, which he calls <i>Mechasipi</i>,
    and who printed, at <i>Paris</i>, an Account of the Country about
    the River, giving it the Name of <i>Louisiana</i>. He ought to have
    stopp’d there, and not to have gone, as he did, into <i>Holland</i>,
    to set forth another Edition, very much enlarg’d, and perhaps not
    so true, which he dedicated to <i>William</i> the Third, Prince of
    <i>Orange</i>, and afterwards King of <i>Great Britain</i>. An Action
    for a Religious Man no less ridiculous than extravagant, not to give
    it a worse Name; for after many great and tedious Encomiums given that
    Protestant Prince, he exhorts and conjures him to turn his Thoughts
    towards those vast Countries, as yet unknown, to conquer them and send
    Colonies thither, to make known to those Savage Nations the true God
    and his Worship, and to preach the Gospel. That good Religious Man,
    whom many have falsly thought, on Account of that Extravagancy, to have
    renounc’d his Religion, did not consider what he said, and consequently
    has scandaliz’d the Catholicks, and furnish’d the <i>Hugonots</i>
    with Matter of Laughter; for it is likely, that they being Enemies
    to the <i>Roman</i> Church, would employ Recolets to go preach up
    <i>Popery</i>, as they call it in <i>Canada</i>? Or would they
    introduce any other Religion than their own? Can Father <i>Hennepin</i>
    be excuseable in this Point?</p>

  <p>In fine it appears, by all that has been writ by those several Persons
    concerning that Enterprize, that the Murder committed on the Person
    of Monsieur <i>de la Sale</i> was the Occasion of its miscarrying;
    but that which obstructed the making of some Provision in that Case
    was, the said Murders being conceal’d for the Space of two Years, and
    that the<span class="sidenote">M. <em>de la Sale’s</em> Fort taken by the
    <em>Spaniards</em>.</span> <i>Spaniards</i> of <i>Mexico</i> having been inform’d of
    all the Affair, sent Men, who carry’d off the weak Garrison Monsieur
    <i>de la Sale</i> had left in the Fort built by him, near the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span> Place
    of his Landing, before he penetrated into the Country, to find out the
    <i>Missisipi</i>. They also entirely raz’d that Fort, so that Seven or
    Eight Years elaps’d, till Monsieur <i>de Hiberville</i>, a Gentleman
    of <i>Canada</i>, and a Person of Capacity and Courage, famous for his
    notable Expeditions to <i>Hudson</i>’s Bay and other Parts, resolv’d
    to reassume and revive that Project. He came over into <i>France</i>
    upon that Design, and made an Armament about the Year 1698, set out and
    sail’d to the Gulf of <i>Mexico</i>.<span class="sidenote">M. <em>de Hiberville’s</em>
    Expedition for the <em>Missisipi</em>.</span> Being an able Seaman, he search’d
    along the Coast so narrowly, that he found the Mouth of that fatal
    <i>Missisipi</i> and built a Fort on it, leaving Men there, with a good
    Quantity of Ammunition and Provisions, and return’d to <i>France</i>,
    intending to go back with a Reinforcement, as he did, and having
    penetrated far into the Country, discover’d several Savage Nations,
    and join’d Friendship and Alliance with them, as also built another
    Fort, which he left well stor’d with Men and Necessaries, return’d into
    <i>France</i>; but attempting a third Voyage, he dy’d by the Way, and
    thus, for want of Relief and Support, that noble Enterprize miscarry’d again.</p>

  <p>But God has now provided for it, and it is the Concern of Heaven, for
    if <i>France</i> is interested on Account of the Temporal Advantages
    it expects, the Church is so in like Manner, for the Conversion of the
    <i>Indians</i> it hopes will follow. Accordingly, Providence has taken
    the Affair in Hand, having rais’d the Man, who is the fittest to revive
    and support so important a Project. This is <i>Monsieur Crozat</i>,
    Secretary to the King, a Man of singular Worth, very Intelligent,
    Well-meaning, and prodigiously Rich, who without going out of his
    Closet, has been the Occasion of many notable Voyages by Sea, and all
    of them successful. To him, his Majesty, by his Letters Patent, bearing
    Date the <i>14th of Septemb. 1712</i>,<span class="sidenote">M. <em>Crozat</em>
    only to plant Colonies and Trade in
    <em>Louisiana</em>.</span> has granted the sole Power to
    trade and settle Colonies in the Countries describ’d in this Journal,
    and which are known to us by the Name of <i>Louisiana</i> and the River
    <i>Missisipi</i>, from hence forward to be call’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span> the River of St.
    <i>Lewis</i>. The Grant is made to him for 15 Years, under several
    Conditions mention’d in the said Letters Patent, which have been made publick.</p>

  <p>And whereas such a Grant cannot subsist without Blacks, he is also
    allow’d to send a Ship to <i>Guinea</i> to purchase them. They may
    perhaps find there the famous Black <i>Aniaga</i>, Brother to a
    King of <i>Guinea</i>, whom Captain <i>Delbee</i> brought over into
    <i>France</i>, above Thirty Years ago. The King was pleas’d to have him
    Educated, Instructed and Baptiz’d, the <i>Dauphin</i><a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> being his
    Godfather; then put him into his Troop of Musquetiers, and afterwards
    made him a Captain in his own Regiment, where he serv’d Honourably.
    Being desirous to see his own Country again, where he promis’d to
    promote the <i>French</i> Trade, and the settling of Missioners, his
    Majesty loaded him with Presents, and order’d a Ship to carry him back
    to <i>Guinea</i>; but as soon as he was there, he no longer remember’d
    he had been baptiz’d, and turn’d again as perfect a Black,
    <span class="sidenote">A Black bred in <em>France</em> turns to his Native
    Customs.</span> as he had
    been before. A Friend of mine, who was an Officer aboard a Ship,
    and hapned to be on that Coast in the Year 1708, had two or three
    Interviews with that Black, who came aboard him. He was a great Man in
    that Country, for his Brother was King. He express’d much Gratitude
    for the Kindness that had been shewn him in <i>France</i>, and was
    extraordinary Courteous, and made great Offers to those aboard the
    Ship, and to all such of the Nation as would go into <i>Guinea</i>.</p>

  <p>This Navigation to <i>Louisiana</i> will farther procure us a
    free Resort to the two famous Ports of the Gulf of <i>Mexico</i>,
    <i>viz.</i> The <i>Havana</i> and <i>Veracruz</i>, where Strangers did
    not use to be admitted, and which we knew only by their Names and their
    Situation in our Maps.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote"><em>Veracruz</em> in New <em>Spain</em>.</span>
    The latter of those Towns is the Port of <i>New Spain</i>, at the
    Bottom of the Bay or Gulf, in 18 Degrees of <i>North</i> Latitude,
    Seated in a Sandy Plain, encompass’d with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>Mountains; beyond which
    there are Woods and Meadows, well Stock’d with Cattle and wild Fowl:
    the flesh whereof is stringy and tasteless. The Air is very Hot, and
    not Healthy, when any Winds blow, except the <i>North</i>, which rises
    commonly once in Eight or Fifteen Days, and holds for the Space of
    Twenty Four Hours, blowing so hard, that there is no going ashore
    from the Ships, and then the Cold is very piercing. When the Weather
    is clear there plainly appear, on the Road to <i>Mexico</i>, two
    Mountains rising above the Clouds, and forty Leagues distant, all
    cover’d with Snow. The Streets of <i>Veracruz</i> are streight as a
    Line; the Houses are handsome and regular; the Fortifications next the
    Land inconsiderable, but the Front of the Town next the Sea forms a
    Semicircle, with a little Fort at each End. Directly before that Front,
    a Quarter of a League out at Sea, there stands, on a Spot of Ground,
    inaccessible, by Reason of the Breaking of the Sea, a strong Citadel,
    well built and furnished with all Necessaries, a good Garrison and
    double Batteries of two hundred Pieces of brass Cannon. Ships cannot
    anchor any where, but between that Citadel and the Town; besides that,
    it requires several Precautions, because it is difficult coming to an Anchor.</p>

  <p>Most of the Inhabitants are <i>Mulattoes</i>, that is of a tawny dark
    Colour, who live most upon Chocolate and Sweetmeats, extraordinary
    sober, and eating little Flesh. The Men are haughty, the Women keep
    retired above Stairs, not to be seen by Strangers, and seldom going
    abroad, and then in Coaches or Chairs, and those who cannot reach
    to it, cover’d with fine silk Veils, which reach from the Crown of
    their Heads to their Feet, leaving only a small Opening on the Right
    Side,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> for them to see their Way. In their own Apartments they wear
    nothing but a Smock and a silk Petticoat, with gold or silver Laces,
    without any Thing on their Heads, and their Hair platted with Ribbons,
    a gold <span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>Chain about their Neck, Bracelets of the same and Pendants of
    Emeralds in their Ears. They could well enough like the Behaviour and
    Company of the French, but that the jealous Temper of the Men obstructs
    them. There being a Picture of <i>Philip</i> King of <i>Spain</i>, now
    reigning, aboard the Ship in which my Friend was, who gave me this
    Account, the People swarm’d aboard to see it, they were never satisfy’d
    with gazing at it, and there was a most magnificent Festival kept in
    the Town, on Account of the Birth of the Prince of <i>Asturias</i>.</p>

  <p>They understand Trade very well, but are sloathful and averse to
    Labour, fond of State and Ease. They wear great Strings of Beads about
    their Necks, their Houses are full of Pictures and Images of Devotion,
    and they have little that is real. They are decently furnish’d with
    Purceline and <i>China</i> Goods. The Churches are magnificently
    adorned with Plate. But the Lives and Manners of the Clergy are not
    Edifying. On Holidays and <i>Sundays</i> there is no Thought of Matins,
    of Sermon, or of Vespers: People chat and laugh in the Churches as well
    as in the Processions, which are often at Night by the Light of Torches.</p>

  <p>All Strangers are forbid Trading there, yet some come by Stealth and
    deal Underhand, by Means of Presents made to such Persons as can favour
    them. If those Mulattoes call themselves white, it is only to honour
    themselves and by Way of Distinction from their Slaves, who are all
    Blacks, and having got much Mony by their Labour, ransome themselves
    and sometimes become considerable Merchants.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote"><em>Mexico</em> City.</span>The City of <i>Mexico</i>, Capital of the Country and the Residence of
    the Vice-roy, is about eighty Leagues distant from <i>Veracruz</i>, to
    the Westward, the Way to it very bad and ill furnish’d with Provisions.
    That Country would be better in some Parts, if the people had the
    skill and energy to till it. They sow but little of our Wheat, and
    are satisfied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span> with
    <i>Indian</i> Corn<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and <i>Cassabi</i> Root,
    whereof they make Cakes, as is practis’d in the Islands. Their Trees
    and Fruits are the same as in other hot Countries. About the Town of
    <i>Veracruz</i>, there are Bushes of a Sort of Thorn, without Leaves,
    among which grows an extraordinary Plant; for tho’ it has but a small
    Stem, it shoots out Leaves of a Cabbage Green, as thick as a Man’s
    Finger, which grow out, one at the End of another, in the Shape of a
    Racket, and the Plant itself is so call’d. From those Leaves there
    grows out a Sort of red Figs, very juicy, with Seeds like those of the
    Pomgranate; the Juice is of a Violet Colour, but unsavoury. There is
    a Sort of Flies that cleave to it and are so fond of the Taste of the
    Fruit, that they burst and drop down dead. They are carefully gather’d
    and dry’d, and are the Scarlet Dye, call’d Cochinilla, which is brought
    into <i>Europe</i>, and makes that beautiful Colour. The Birds and
    Beasts are much the same as in other Countries of <i>America</i>.
    There is a Sort of Bird, all red, which for that Reason is call’d
    the <i>Cardinal</i>; this they often tame and teach to sing like a
    <i>Canary</i> Bird. This is what I have been told concerning the Town
    of <i>Veracruz</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote"><em>Havana</em>.</span>
    As for the <i>Havana</i>, a Town and Port no less famous, in the
    Island of <i>Cuba</i>, belonging as well as the other to the Crown of
    <i>Spain</i>, it stands towards the Western End, and on the North Side
    of that Island, almost under the Tropick of <i>Cancer</i>, and about
    four or five hundred Leagues on this Side of <i>Veracruz</i>. It is
    large and beautiful; the Port good, secur’d by two Forts on the two
    Sides, and good artillery, from twenty four to thirty six Pounds, the
    Entrance so narrow, that only one Vessel can go in at once. The Town
    is encompass’d by a good Wall, fortify’d with five Bastions, furnish’d
    with Cannon. The Streets are all as strait as a Line, and level, the
    Houses very handsome, but ill furnish’d. In the Midst of it is a fine
    Square, the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>Buildings about all uniform. The Churches are magnificent,
    and enrich’d with Gold and Silver, Lamps, Candlesticks, and Ornaments
    for the Altars. There are some Lamps curiously wrought, which weigh
    two hundred Marks of Silver, [each Mark being half a Pound.]<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The
    Revenue of the Bishoprick amounts to more than fifty thousand Crowns,
    and he who enjoy’d it in the Year 1703, as I was inform’d by my Friend,
    who gave me this Account of what he had seen, was the greatest Ornament
    of that City, for his Virtues and Charity, being satisfy’d with
    Necessaries, and spending all the rest upon the Poor, and in repairing
    decay’d Churches. Tho’ Strangers are prohibited to trade there, yet
    it is easier carried on than at <i>Veracruz</i>. The Inhabitants
    are more familiar; the Women have more Liberty, yet they do not go
    Abroad without their Veils to wrap and hide them. Many of them speak
    <i>French</i>, and dress after the <i>French</i> Fashion, and some of
    our Nation have settled themselves there. When my Friend was there,
    a magnificent Festival was celebrated for fifteen Days successively,
    in Honour of K. <i>Philip</i> the Fifth, and Monsieur <i>du Casse</i>
    being then there, with his Squadron, the City desir’d him to join with
    them. To that Purpose, he set ashore five hundred Men, who perform’d
    the Martial Exercise in the great Square, which was much admir’d.
    The <i>Havana</i> is the Place, where the Galeons meet. By this word
    should not be understood ships of extraordinary size; for most of them
    are but very inconsiderable craft which <i>Spanish</i> vanity strives
    to magnify by a swelling name. But if these ships are not great,
    their precious freight is so. For all that, this city, the gateway
    to the treasures of the <i>West Indies</i>, is full of beggars—but
    it is by their own fault, and by their idleness that they are such.
    Provisions are dear there, especially Bread; but the Wine is not, tho’
    it is good. Fish and Flesh there, are unsavory. The Inhabitants are
    <i>Spaniards</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span></p>

  <p>We have thought fit to describe those two famous Ports of the Bay
    of <i>Mexico</i>, as well because it has not been so exactly done
    before, as in Regard that the Settlement which is going to be made
    in <i>Louisiana</i>, may have some Dependance on them; for the
    <i>Havana</i> lying in the Way, those who perform the Voyage may have
    the Conveniency of taking in Refreshments there, of putting in for
    Shelter in foul Weather, and of careening or refitting. As for the
    <i>Veracruz</i>, tho’ farther out of the Way, the Correspondence there
    may be advantagious for the Securing of the Colony of <i>Louisiana</i>.</p>

  <p>But how can that fail of succeeding, under the Conduct of <i>Monsieur
    Crozat</i>, who has the Charge of that Enterprize, and whom Providence
    seems to have in a Manner ingag’d to advance in Wealth and Honour, to
    the Amazement of the World, and yet free from Envy, from Jealousy, and
    from any Sort of Complaints. There is therefore no Reason to presage
    otherwise than well of the Event of this Affair; the Blessings God has
    pour’d down upon all his former Undertakings, seem to be a Security for
    what is to follow. There is Reason to hope for still greater Blessings
    on this Project of a Settlement in <i>Louisiana</i>, as being equally
    advantagious to Religion and the State; for the propagating of the
    Knowledge and Service of God among an infinite Number of Savages, by
    Means of the Missioners, who are to be sent to and maintain’d in those
    vast Countries; the Planting of the Faith in that New World, only the
    Name whereof is known to us, and the Reducing of it to be a Christian
    and a <i>French</i> Province, under the Dominion of our August Monarch,
    and to the eternal Memory of his Reign, will be the Consequences and
    the Fruits of <i>Monsieur Crozat</i>’s Care and Expence, the Glory of
    his Enterprize, the Security of the large Fortune he has made in this
    Life, and what is rare among such rich Men, the Earnest of much better
    in the Next. Heaven grant our Hopes and Wishes may be answer’d.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">L<i>OUIS</i>, by the Grace of God, King of <i>France</i> and
    <i>Navarre</i>: To all who shall see these present Letters, Greeting.
    The Care we have always had to procure the Welfare and Advantage of
    our Subjects having induced us, notwithstanding the almost continual
    Wars which we have been obliged to support from the Beginning of
    our Reign, to seek for all possible Opportunities of enlarging and
    extending the Trade of our American Colonies, <i>We did in the Year
    1683 give our orders to undertake a Discovery of the Countries and
    Lands which are situated in the Northern Part of America</i>, between
    New France and New Mexico: <i>And the Sieur</i> de la Sale, <i>to whom
    we committed that Enterprize, having had Success enough to confirm
    a Belief that a Communication might be settled</i> from New France
    to the Gulph of Mexico by Means of large Rivers; <i>This obliged us
    immediately after the Peace of</i> Ryswick <i>to give Orders for the
    establishing a Colony there, and maintaining a Garrison which has kept
    and preserved</i> the Possession, we had taken <i>in the very Year
    1683 of the Lands, Coasts and Islands which are situated in the Gulph
    of Mexico, between Carolina on the East, and Old and New Mexico on
    the West</i>. But a new War having broke out in Europe shortly after,
    there was no Possibility, till now, of reaping from that new Colony
    the Advantages that might have been expected from thence, because
    the private Men, who are concerned in the Sea Trade, were all under
    Engagements with other Colonies, which they have been obliged to
    follow: And whereas upon the Information we have received concerning
    the Disposition and Situation of the said Countries known at present
    by the Name of the Province of <i>Louisiana</i>, we are of Opinion
    that there may be established therein a considerable Commerce, so
    much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span> the more advantageous to our Kingdom in that there has hitherto
    been a Necessity of fetching from Foreigners the greatest Part of the
    Commodities which may be brought from thence, and because in Exchange
    thereof we need carry thither nothing but Commodities of the Growth and
    Manufacture of our own Kingdom; we have resolved to grant the Commerce
    of the Country of <i>Louisiana</i> to the <i>Sieur Anthony Crozat</i>
    our Councellor, Secretary of the Household, Crown and Revenue, to whom
    we entrust the Execution of this Project. We are the more readily
    inclined hereunto, because his Zeal and the singular Knowledge he has
    acquired in maritime Commerce, encourage us to hope for as good Success
    as he has hitherto had in the divers and sundry Enterprizes he has gone
    upon, and which have procured to our Kingdom great Quantities of Gold
    and Silver in such Conjunctures as have rendered them very welcome to us.</p>

  <p>FOR THESE REASONS being desirous to shew our Favour to him, and to
    regulate the Conditions upon which we mean to grant him the said
    Commerce, after having deliberated this Affair in our Council, Of
    our certain Knowledge, full Power and Royal Authority, We by these
    Presents, signed by our Hand, have appointed and do appoint the said
    <i>Sieur Crozat solely to carry on a Trade in all the Lands</i>
    possessed by Us, and bounded by New Mexico, and by the Lands of
    the English of Carolina, <i>all the Establishment, Ports, Havens,
    Rivers, and principally the Port and Haven of the Isle</i> Dauphine,
    <i>heretofore called</i> Massacre; <i>the River of</i> St. Lewis,
    <i>heretofore called</i> Missisipi, <i>from the Edge of the Sea
    as far as the</i> Illinois; <i>together with the River of</i> St.
    Philip, <i>heretofore called the</i> Missourys, <i>and of</i> St.
    Jerome, <i>heretofore called</i> Ovabache, <i>with all the Countries,
    Territories, Lakes within Land, and the Rivers which fall directly or
    indirectly into that Part of the River of</i> St. Lewis.</p>

  <p><abbr title="1">I</abbr>. Our Pleasure is, that all the aforesaid Lands, Countries, Streams,
    Rivers and Islands be and remain comprised under the Name of <i>The
    Government of</i> Louisiana, <i>which shall be dependant upon the
    General Government of New France</i>, to which it is subordinate; and
    further, that all the Lands which we possess from the <i>Islinois</i>
    be united, so far as Occasion requires, to the General Government
    of <i>New France</i>, and become Part thereof, reserving however to
    Ourselves the Liberty of enlarging as We shall think fit the Extent of
    the Government of the said Country of <i>Louisiana</i>.</p>

  <p><abbr title="2">II</abbr>. We grant to the said <i>Sieur Crozat</i> for Fifteen successive
    Years, to be reckon’d from the Day of Inrolling these presents, a
    Right and Power to transport all Sorts of Goods and Merchandize from
    <i>France</i> into the said Country of <i>Louisiana</i>, and to
    traffick thither as he shall think fit. We forbid all and every Person
    and Persons, Company and Companies of what Quality or Condition soever,
    and under any Pretence whatever, to trade thither, under Penalty of
    Confiscation of Goods, Ships, and other more severe Punishments, as
    Occasion shall require; for this Purpose we order our Governours and
    other Officers commanding our Troops in the said Country forcibly to
    abet, aid and assist the Directors and Agents of the said <i>Sieur Crozat</i>.</p>

  <p><abbr title="3">III</abbr>. We permit him to search for, open and dig all Sorts of Mines,
    Veins and Minerals throughout the whole Extent of the said Country of
    <i>Louisiana</i>, and to transport the Profits thereof into any Port of
    <i>France</i> during the said Fifteen Years; and we grant in Perpetuity
    to him, his Heirs, and others claiming under him or them, the Property
    of, in and to the Mines, Veins and Minerals which he shall bring to
    bear, paying us, in Lieu of all Claim, the Fifth Part of the Gold and
    Silver which the said <i>Sieur Crozat</i> shall cause to be transported
    to <i>France</i> at his own Charges into what Port he pleases, (of
    which Fifth we will run the Risque of the Sea and of War,) and the
    Tenth Part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span> what Effects he shall draw from the other Mines, Veins
    and Minerals, which Tenth he shall transfer and convey to our Magazines
    in the said Country of <i>Louisiana</i>.</p>

  <p>We likewise permit him to search for precious Stones and Pearls, paying
    us the Fifth Part in the same Manner as is mention’d for the Gold and
    Silver.</p>

  <p>We will that the said <i>Sieur Crozat</i>, his Heirs, or those claiming
    under him or them the perpetual Right, shall forfeit the Propriety of
    the said Mines, Veins and Minerals, if they discontinue the Work during
    three Years, and that in such Case the said Mines, Veins and Minerals
    shall be fully reunited to our Domaine, by Virtue of this present
    Article, without the Formality of any Process of Law, but only an
    Ordinance of Re-union from the Subdelegate of the Intendant of <i>New
    France</i>, who shall be in the said Country, nor do we mean that the
    said Penalty of Forfeiture in Default of working for three Years, be
    reputed a Comminatory Penalty.</p>

  <p><abbr title="4">IV</abbr>. The said <i>Sieur Crozat</i> may vend all such Merchandize, Goods,

    transported into the said Country and Government of <i>Louisiana</i>,
    as well to the <i>French</i>, as <i>Savages</i> who are or shall be
    there setled; nor shall any Person or Persons under any Pretence
    whatsoever be capable of doing the like without his Leave expressed in

    and transport them to <i>France</i> during the said Fifteen Years:
    And as our Intention is to favour, as much as we can, our Inhabitants
    of <i>New France</i>, and to hinder the Lessening of their Trade,
    we forbid him Trafficking for Castor in the said Country under any
    Pretence whatsoever; nor to Convey any from thence into our Kingdom or
    Foreign Countries.</p>

  <p><abbr title="6">VI</abbr>. We Grant to the <i>Sieur Crozat</i>, his Heirs or those claiming

  <h3>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL ACCOUNT OF THE TRAVELS OF NICOLET, ALLOÜEZ,
    MARQUETTE, HENNEPIN, AND LA SALLE IN THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.</h3>

  <p>The pioneer of French travellers to the country west of the great
    lakes, and the first white man who is reputed to have reached a
    northern tributary of the Mississippi, was Jean Nicolet, who in 1634,
    or thereabouts, made treaties with the Indians at Green Bay, and
    ascended Fox River.</p>

  <p>The “<span lang="fr">Relation de ce qui s’est passé en la Nouvelle France</span>, 1640,”
    Paris, 1641, gives the earliest indication of this voyage, and a
    summary description is given in the Relation of 1642–43. These reports
    are reprinted in the “Relation des Jésuites,” vol. <abbr title="1">i</abbr>., Québec, 1858.
    Margry’s “Découvertes et établissements des Français,” vol. <abbr title="1">i</abbr>., pp.
    47–53, contains the portions of the above which refer to Nicolet,
    and a translation of the account in the Relation of 1640 is printed
    in Smith’s “History of Wisconsin,” vol. <abbr title="3">iii</abbr>. Du Creux’s “Historia
    Canadensis,” Paris, 1664, gives the first connected history of the life
    and exploits of this explorer. A translation of Du Creux’s narrative is
    appended to Butterfield’s “History and Discovery of the Northwest, by
    John Nicolet,” Cincinnati, 1881.</p>

  <p>Shea states, in his “Discovery and Exploration of the Mississippi,”
    that Nicolet descended the Wisconsin to the Mississippi. This opinion
    was adopted by Parkman in his “Jesuits in North America,” p. 166, but
    his later judgment is given in the “Discovery of the Great West.” A
    more careful examination of the evidence demonstrates the improbability
    that his travels extended farther than the Wisconsin, and in the
    opinion of Butterfield, the latest writer upon this voyage, he did not
    reach that river, but stopped at the country of the Mascoutins upon Fox River.</p>

  <p>Benjamin Sulté, a Canadian historical writer, in writing upon Nicolet,
    in his “Mélanges d’Histoire et de Littérature,” Ottawa, 1876, shows,
    for the first time, that this journey was probably made in 1634,
    instead of 1638 or 1639, as before thought.</p>

  <p>Sulté’s article with notes by L. C. Draper, is printed in the
    “Wisconsin Historical Society Collections,” vol. <abbr title="8">viii</abbr>., pp. 188–194;
    also in the “Canadian Antiquarian,” vol. <abbr title="8">viii</abbr>., pp. 157–164.</p>

  <p>Butterfield, who has carefully investigated the records, agrees with
    Sulté in assigning 1634 as the true date, and brings out additional,
    if not conclusive evidence to support this theory, in his monograph
    cited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span> above. Margry, in the “Journal de l’Instruction publique,” 1862,
    under the caption, “Les Normands dans les Vallées de l’Ohio et du
    Mississipi,” describes Nicolet’s travels and Gravier’s “Découvertes et
    établissements de la Salle;” Harrisse’s “Notes pour servir à l’Histoire
    [etc.] de la Nouvelle France,” and Parkman’s “La Salle,” also give some
    account of the expedition.</p>

  <p>In 1642 Jogues and Raymbault, two missionaries, penetrated as far west
    as Sault Ste. Marie, at the outlet of Lake Superior. See account of
    this mission in the Jesuit Relation of 1642. Margry’s Collection, vol.
    <abbr title="1">i</abbr>., pp. 45–47, contains a reprint of the narrative of this journey. See
    also Shea’s Charlevoix, vol. <abbr title="1">i</abbr>., p. 137, for notice of the undertaking.</p>

  <p>The next recorded visit to the West is that of two French traders,
    who wintered upon the shores of Lake Superior in 1658. See the Jesuit
    Relation of 1659–60, and the extract in Margry’s Collection, vol. <abbr title="1">i</abbr>.,
    pp. 53–55, and translation in Smith’s Wisconsin, vol. <abbr title="3">iii</abbr>., p. 20.
    Father Ménard began a mission at St. Theresa Bay, Lake Superior, in
    1661. See Lallemant’s letter in the Relation of 1662–63. A translation
    of this letter is in Smith’s Wisconsin, vol. <abbr title="3">iii</abbr>. See also Perrot’s
    “Mémoire sur les mœurs des sauvages,” Paris, 1864; Shea’s Charlevoix,
    vol. <abbr title="1">i</abbr>., p. 49, and a note by Shea in <i>Historical Magazine</i>, vol.
    <abbr title="8">viii</abbr>., p. 175. Ménard’s letter, written just before his departure
    for Lake Superior, with notes by E. D. Neill, may be found in the
    “Minnesota Historical Society Collections,” vol. <abbr title="1">i</abbr>., pp. 135–138.</p>

  <p>In 1665, Claude Alloüez, another missionary, began a mission at
    Chegoimegon, Lake Superior. See the journal of his travels in Le
    Mercier’s Relation of 1666–67, a translation of which is in Smith’s
    Wisconsin, vol. <abbr title="3">iii</abbr>. Marquette took charge of this mission in 1669, and
    Alloüez went to the Baie des Puantes (Green Bay), and in 1670 made a
    visit to the Mascoutins on Fox River. Harrisse thinks he crossed to the
    Wisconsin at this time. In reporting his operations, Alloüez describes
    the “Messi-sipi” from information given by the Indians. See Dablon’s
    Relation of 1669–70, p. 100. Translation in Smith’s “Wisconsin,” vol. <abbr title="3">iii</abbr>.</p>

  <p>Alloüez spent many years among the Indians upon Green Bay, and in the
    Illinois country. See the Jesuit Relations covering the years 1669–79.
    The full titles of these Relations are given in chronological order
    in Harrisse’s “Notes pour servir à l’Histoire [etc.] de la Nouvelle
    France.” Dr. Shea printed in the Cramoisy series the abridged Relations
    for 1672–79, and Martin’s “Mission du Canada” prints them for the
    first time in full. Shea gives a life of Alloüez in his “Discovery and
    Exploration of the Mississippi.” See also notes upon him in Margry’s
    Découvertes, etc., vol. <abbr title="1">i</abbr>., pp. 57–72; also in Bancroft, in Shea’s
    Charlevoix, vol. <abbr title="3">iii</abbr>., and in Shea’s “Catholic Missions in the United
    States.” Gravier and Parkman also give some account of his travels.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span></p>

  <p>In June, 1671, St. Lusson, in the presence of a large number of
    Indians, took possession of the country on the lakes in the name of
    France. The “Procès verbal” of the ceremony is in Margry, vol. <abbr title="1">i</abbr>., pp.
    96 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>Perrot, a noted Canadian <i>voyageur</i>, in 1670–71 travelled along
    the shores of Green Bay. Perrot’s journal, which records the daily
    events of his life among the Indians from 1665 to 1726, was edited for
    the first time at Paris, in 1864, by Father Tailhan. It is entitled
    “Mémoires sur les mœurs et coustumes et relligion [sic] des sauvages
    de l’Amérique septentrionale.” Tailhan’s notes add value to the work.
    See regarding Perrot, Shea’s Charlevoix, vol. <abbr title="3">iii</abbr>., p. 165, and
    <i>Historical Magazine</i>, vol. <abbr title="9">ix</abbr>., p. 205.</p>

  <p>A description of the geography of the country as known previous to
    the exploration of the Mississippi by Joliet and Marquette is given
    by Dablon in the “Relation de la Nouvelle France, les années 1670 et
    1671,” Paris, 1672. See the Quebec reprint in “Relation des Jésuites,”
    vol. <abbr title="3">iii</abbr>. The Relation, as printed in 1672, gave a map of the great
    lakes; for a description of which see Parkman’s “La Salle,” p. 450.</p>

  <p>In 1673 Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet navigated the Mississippi
    in canoes to the Arkansas. Father Marquette’s narrative of the voyage,
    in an imperfect form, was published by Thevenot in his “Recueil de
    Voyages,” Paris, 1681. Thevenot also published it as an independent
    work, with the title, “Voyage et découverte de quelques pays et
    nations de l’Amérique septentrionale.” In this latter shape it was
    reproduced by Rich, at Paris, in 1845. The map accompanying this
    version, and which is inserted in fac-simile in Bancroft, is said not
    to be by Marquette. The authentic map was first published in Shea’s
    “Discovery and Exploration of the Mississippi,” where the two maps are
    compared. The Thevenot text appears translated in French’s “Historical
    Collections of Louisiana,” pt. 2, pp. 279–297, and Spark’s “Life of
    Marquette,” in the “Library of American Biography,” vol. <abbr title="10">x</abbr>., is, in a
    measure, a translation of it.</p>

  <p>Marquette’s complete journal, prepared for publication, in 1678,
    by Claude Dablon, Superior of the Canadian Missions, remained
    inedited until Shea published it in his “Discovery and Exploration
    of the Mississippi,” New York, 1853, giving the original text and a
    translation. This version, known as the <i>Ste. Marie</i> text, was
    reprinted in 1855, with important annotations, by Shea, under the
    title, “Récit des voyages et des découvertes du R. P. J. Marquette,
    en l’année 1673, et aux suivantes; la continuation de ses voyages
    par C. Alloüez, et le journal autographe, du P. Marquette en 1674 et
    1675.” [Albanie: Imprimerie de Weed, Parsons et Cie.] 1855 (10), 169
    (2), pp. Map, 12mo. Martin’s “Mission du Canada, Relations inédites
    (1672–1679),” vol. <abbr title="2">ii</abbr>., contains a modified version of the <i>Ste.
    Marie</i> text. Hennepin’s spurious “New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span> Discovery,” London, 1698
    and 1699, has, as an appendix, a poor translation of the Thevenot
    production.</p>

  <p>Joliet, while on his way to Montreal to report his discoveries, lost
    his memoranda and maps. He was enabled, however, to draw up a brief
    recital from memory, which, with a map, he presented to Frontenac in
    1674.</p>

  <p>Two versions of this narrative are printed in Margry’s Collection, vol.
    <abbr title="1">i</abbr>., pp. 259–270. Dablon despatched to his Superior at Paris an account
    derived from Joliet’s verbal testimony, which may be found printed in
    Martin’s “Mission du Canada,” vol. <abbr title="1">i</abbr>., pp. 193–204. A translation is
    given in the <i>Historical Magazine</i>, vol. <abbr title="5">v</abbr>., pp. 237–239. A letter
    sent by Joliet from Quebec, October 10, 1674, briefly recounts his
    late adventures. It may be found in Harrisse’s “Notes pour servir à
    l’Histoire [etc.] de la Nouvelle France,” pp. 322 and 323. A narrative
    based upon Joliet’s report is appended to Hennepin’s “New Discovery,”
    London, 1698.</p>

  <p>Joliet made several maps, showing his discoveries, only one of which
    has been edited. Gravier’s “Étude sur une carte inconnue, la première
    dressée par L. Joliet en 1674,” contains a fac-simile of the map in
    question. A letter from the discoverer to Frontenac is inscribed upon
    it. Gravier considers this map, apparently with good reason, to be the
    earliest representation of the course of the Mississippi from personal
    knowledge.</p>

  <p>Frontenac’s letter announcing the successful result of Joliet’s mission
    is printed in Margry, vol. <abbr title="1">i</abbr>., p. 257, and a translation is inserted in
    the “New York Colonial Documents,” vol. <abbr title="9">ix</abbr>., p. 116. See the following
    for notices of Joliet: Faillon’s “Histoire de la Colonie française en
    Canada,” vol. <abbr title="3">iii</abbr>.; Ferland’s “Notes sur les régistres de Notre-Dame;”
    Margry’s articles in the <i>Revue Canadienne</i>, December, 1871,
    January, March, 1872. French’s Historical Collections, second series,
    has a brief biography. The works hereafter cited upon the history of
    the discovery of the Mississippi necessarily include a history of the
    Marquette-Joliet expedition.</p>

  <p>We now come to La Salle, Hennepin, and Tonty, 1669–87. Margry’s
    “Découvertes et établissements des Français dans l’Ouest et dans le sud
    de l’Amérique septentrionale, 1614–1698,” Paris, 1879–81, contains the
    documents which the editor collected in the archives of France. This
    work now comprises four large octavo volumes, three of which are mainly
    devoted to documents upon La Salle’s explorations. The contents of
    these three volumes are arranged under the following heads: 1re partie,
    “Voyages des Français sur les grands lacs et Découverte de l’Ohio et du
    Mississipi (1614–1684);” 2me partie, “Lettres de La Salle;” 3me partie,
    “Recherche des bouches du Mississipi (1669–1698).” The more important
    of these papers are indicated hereafter in their chronological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span> order.
    The fourth volume of this collection embraces the documents relating to
    D’Iberville’s colony, at the mouth of the Mississippi, 1698–1703.</p>

  <p>In 1669 La Salle, accompanied by Dollier and Gallinée, set out from
    Montreal to discover the Mississippi. They proceeded in company
    to the western extremity of Lake Ontario. At this place La Salle,
    professing illness, parted from the missionaries, ostensibly to
    return to Montreal. Dollier and Gallinée continued their journey
    along the northern shores of Lake Erie, thus taking a course hitherto
    untravelled, and reached Sault Ste. Marie in May, 1670, having spent
    the winter on the shores of Lake Erie. Gallinée’s journal, entitled
    “Récit de ce qui s’est passé de plus rémarquable dans le voyage de MM.
    Dollier et Gallinée,” is printed in Margry, vol. <abbr title="1">i</abbr>., pp. 112–166. The
    Abbé Faillon, who first discovered the records of this journey, gives
    a synopsis of Gallinée’s recital, with a fac-simile of his map, in the
    third volume of his “Histoire de la Colonie française en Canada.”</p>

  <p>O. M. Marshall’s pamphlet, entitled “The First Visit of La Salle to
    the Senecas,” Buffalo, 1874, contains a textual translation of this
    document. The Société historique, of Montreal, published in 1875 an
    edition of this journal, with notes by the Abbé Verreau. Margry prints
    in his collection, vol. <abbr title="1">i</abbr>., pp. 342–402, a narrative which he calls
    “Récital d’un ami de l’Abbé de Gallinée.” This purports to be notes,
    taken by the writer, who Margry thinks was the Abbé Renaudot, of
    conversations had with La Salle at Paris in 1678, in which he recounted
    his adventures in Canada from 1667 to 1678. In it is stated that after
    leaving Dollier and Gallinée, instead of going to Montreal, La Salle
    kept on until he reached the Ohio, and later went to the Mississippi
    by way of the Illinois. Parkman prints extracts from this paper in
    his “Discovery of the Great West,” but does not credit it wholly; he,
    however, admits that La Salle discovered the Ohio, and most likely the
    Illinois. It is upon this document, that Margry bases his claim that La
    Salle was the first to reach the Mississippi.</p>

  <p>The following writers take issue with Margry: Brucker, “J. Marquette
    et la Découverte du Mississipi,” Lyon, 1880, and in the “Études
    religieuses,” vol. <abbr title="5">v</abbr>.; Harrisse, in “Notes pour servir à l’Histoire
    [etc.] de la Nouvelle France,” Paris, 1872; in an article entitled
    “Histoire critique de la Découverte du Mississipi,” in the <i>Revue
    maritime et coloniale</i>, vol. <abbr title="32">xxxii</abbr>, pp. 642–663.</p>

  <p>Shea, in whom Margry finds perhaps his most strenuous opponent,
    discusses the question in an address read on the bi-centennial of
    Marquette’s voyage, published in the “Wisconsin Historical Society
    Collections,” vol. <abbr title="7">vii</abbr>., pp. 111–122. He has, however, published a
    pamphlet, in which he examines the matter more in detail, entitled “The
    Bursting of P. Margry’s La Salle Bubble,” New York, 1879. Tailhan, in
    notes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span> to Perrot, and the Abbé Verreau in his edition of Gallinée’s
    journal, also refute Margry. Colonel Whittlesey’s tract, forming No.
    38 of the Western Reserve Historical Society’s publications, entitled
    “Discovery of the Ohio by La Salle, 1669–70,” is an inquiry upon the
    subject. Margry presents his arguments in full, in articles upon “Les
    Normands dans les vallées de l’Ohio et du Mississippi,” published in
    the <i>Journal géneral de l’Instruction publique</i>, Paris, 1862. See
    also a paper by him in the <i>Revue maritime et coloniale</i>, vol.

    supports the Margry theory.</p>

  <p>In August, 1679, La Salle having completed his arrangements and
    obtained letters patent from the king for another attempt upon the
    Mississippi, set sail in the Griffon, upon Lake Erie, and arrived at
    Michilimackinac about two weeks later. The Illinois was reached in
    January, 1680, but owing to adverse circumstances, La Salle being
    compelled, for want of supplies and other causes, to make twice the
    journey between the Illinois and Canada, the exploration of the
    Mississippi was not accomplished until April, 1682. The adventures of
    La Salle’s party upon the great lakes and in the Illinois country,
    previous to the voyage down the Mississippi in 1682, are recounted with
    minute detail in the “Relation des Descouvertes et des Voyages du Sieur
    de La Salle, 1679–81,” printed in Margry’s Collection, vol. <abbr title="1">i</abbr>., pp.
    435–594.</p>

  <p>Margry considers this paper to be the official report drawn up by the
    Abbé Bernou from La Salle’s letters. The account of the journey to Fort
    Crevecœur in 1679–80, given in this narrative, is nearly identical
    with the description of the same voyage in Hennepin’s “Description de
    la Louisiane.” For this reason Margry charges Hennepin with plagiary,
    which calls out a defence of the latter by Shea, in his edition of
    Hennepin’s “Louisiana,” where the two narratives are compared. Membré’s
    journal in Le Clercq’s “Premier Établissement de la Foy,” Paris, 1691,
    which is reproduced in English in Shea’s “Discovery and Exploration
    of the Mississippi,” and Tonty’s Memoirs, which will be more fully
    described farther on, also report this stage of the explorations.
    Hennepin’s spurious “Nouvelle Découverte” also contains an account,
    which does not differ materially from that given in the “Description de
    la Louisiane.”</p>

  <p>Mathieu Sâgean, who claimed to have been with La Salle in 1679–80,
    dictated from memory, in 1701, a report of his adventures in Canada.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
    See Parkman’s La Salle, p. 658, concerning Sâgean’s pretensions. Shea
    published Sâgean’s narrative in 1863, with the title, <span lang="fr">“Extrait de la
    Relation des avantures et voyage de M. Sâgean.”</span></p>

  <p>In February, 1680, Hennepin, by La Salle’s orders, set out from Fort
    Crevecœur for the upper Mississippi. He ascended that river to the
    Sioux country, and discovered St. Anthony’s Falls. Hennepin’s first
    work, “Description de la Louisiane,” Paris, 1683, relates the events
    of this expedition, and also gives an account of La Salle’s journey
    from Canada to the Illinois in 1679–80. Shea gives in his “Discovery
    and Exploration of the Mississippi” the portion of this work relating
    the voyage to the upper Mississippi. Hennepin’s works are held in
    disrepute, owing to undoubted plagiarisms and falsifications which
    characterize some of them. Shea, however, shows in the preface to
    his edition of the “Description of Louisiana,” New York, 1880, that
    this charge applies only to the “Nouvelle Découverte” and “Nouveau
    Voyage,” and other works made up from these two last, and that they
    were probably published without Hennepin’s sanction. Parkman agrees
    with Shea in considering the “Description de la Louisiane” to be an
    authentic work.</p>

  <p>For criticisms upon Hennepin, see Sparks’ “La Salle;” Parkman’s
    “Discovery of the Great West;” Harrisse’s “Notes pour servir à
    l’Histoire [etc.] de la Nouvelle France,” p. 145; and the preface to
    Margry’s Découvertes, etc. Shea’s early judgment upon Hennepin, which
    he has modified as indicated above, is given in his “Discovery and
    Exploration of the Mississippi.” E. D. Neill, in a pamphlet entitled
    “The Writings of L. Hennepin,” lately published by the Minnesota
    Historical Society, dissents from Shea’s exculpation of Hennepin, and
    declares that no evidence has been produced to clear him from the
    charge of plagiary.</p>

  <p>The bi-centenary of Hennepin’s discovery of St. Anthony’s Falls was
    celebrated by the Minnesota Historical Society in 1880, and the
    proceedings on the occasion will be reported in the next volume of its
    collections. The account of a pretended voyage by Hennepin down the
    Mississippi, taken from the spurious “New Discovery,” London, 1698, is
    inserted in “French’s Historical Collections,” part i., pp. 195–222;
    also in volume one of the “Archæologia Americana,” published by the
    American Antiquarian Society. The latter work also contains an account
    of La Salle’s last voyage, taken from the same unreliable source.</p>

  <p>Shea’s edition of Hennepin’s “Louisiana” contains a bibliography of
    the numerous memoirs, issued under Hennepin’s name, where also may be
    found a translation of La Salle’s letter of August, 1682, reporting
    the voyage on the upper Mississippi. Du L’hut, who, in 1679, visited
    the Sioux near Lake Superior, and later descended the St. Croix to the
    Mississippi and rescued Hennepin from the Sioux, gives an account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span> of
    his adventures in a “Mémoire sur la Découverte du pays des Nadouecioux
    dans le Canada,” which is printed in Harrisse’s Notes, pp. 177–181, and
    translated in Shea’s Hennepin.</p>

  <p>The <span lang="fr">“Procès verbal de prise de possession de la Louisiane, à
    l’embouchure de la mer ou Golphe du Mexique, 9 avril, 1682,”</span> in Margry,
    vol. <abbr title="2">ii</abbr>., pp. 186–193, gives the principal incidents of the voyage down
    the Mississippi from the Illinois. This document may also be found in
    Gravier’s “La Salle,” and in English in Sparks’ “Life of La Salle,”
    also in French’s “Historical Collections,” part i., and with the title,
    “Narrative of the Expedition of La Salle to explore the (Mississippi)
    Colbert River, in 1682,” in French’s Historical Collections, second
    series, pp. 17–27, New York, 1875.</p>

  <p>La Salle’s letter, written at the junction of the Missouri and
    Mississippi Rivers, printed in Margry, vol. <abbr title="2">ii</abbr>., pp. 164–180,
    a translation of which is given in <i>The Magazine of American
    History</i>, vol. <abbr title="2">ii</abbr>., pp. 619–622, describes the journey to the
    Missouri.</p>

  <p>The procès verbal of the act of taking possession at the Arkansas,
    March 13 and 14, 1682, in Margry, vol. <abbr title="2">ii</abbr>., p. 181, reports another
    stage of the voyage. Membré’s journal of the entire expedition, first
    printed in Le Clercq’s “Établissement de la Foy,” Paris, 1691, is
    reproduced in English in Shea’s “Discovery of the Mississippi.” Shea
    has lately brought out an English translation of Le Clercq under
    the title, “First Establishment of the Faith in New France,” New
    York, 1881, two vols. 8vo. He there compares Membré’s narrative with
    Hennepin’s “Nouvelle Découverte” and “Nouveau Voyage,” and also points
    out the variations between it and the account published by Thomassy in
    his “Géologie pratique de la Louisiane.”</p>

  <p>Thomassy’s document is entitled, “Relation de la Découverte de
    l’embouchure de la Rivière Mississipi.” Parkman considers it to be the
    “official report of the discovery made by La Salle, or perhaps for him
    by Membré,” and says that the Le Clercq narrative is based upon it.</p>

  <p>To which Shea replies, that it “seems strange to assume that the fuller
    document given by Le Clercq must be drawn from a shorter form.”</p>

  <p>The two documents are essentially identical, and afford trustworthy
    data upon the voyage.</p>

  <p>According to Boimare, a manuscript copy of Membré’s journal exists in
    the library at Baton Rouge, Louisiana.</p>

  <p>Henri de Tonty, who was with La Salle from 1678–83, reports the
    explorations during that time, in a memoir written at Quebec in
    1684, which is published for the first time in Margry, vol. <abbr title="1">i</abbr>., pp.
    571–616. Another narrative by him, entitled “Mémoire envoyé en 1693
    sur la Découverte du Mississipi, par de La Salle en 1678, et depuis sa
    mort par le sieur de Tonty,” is printed in its integrity in Margry’s
    “Relations et Mémoires inédits,” pp. 1–36, Paris, 1867. A translation
    of it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span> is included in French’s “Historical Collections,” part i., pp.
    52–83, and also in Falconer’s “Mississippi,” London, 1844. These two
    memoirs formed the basis of the work published under Tonty’s name, but
    which he disavowed, entitled “Dernieres découvertes dans l’Amérique
    septentrionale de M. de La Salle,” Paris, 1697.</p>

  <p>This work was reproduced under the title of “Relation de la Louisianne”
    in Bernard’s “Recueil de voyages au Nord,” Amsterdam, 1720 and 1724.</p>

  <p>An English translation was published at London in 1698, with the title,
    “An Account of La Salle’s Last Expedition and Discoveries,” and is
    reproduced in part in the New York Historical Society Collections, vol.
    <abbr title="2">ii</abbr>., pp. 217–341.</p>

  <p>Parkman says that the “Dernieres découvertes” is “a compilation full of
    errors.”</p>

  <p>Margry prints in vol. <abbr title="1">i</abbr>., pp. 547–570, of his Collection, a memoir
    entitled “Récit de la descouverte que M. de La Salle a faite de la
    rivière de Mississipi en 1682.” The author of the paper was Nicolas
    de La Salle, who wrote it in 1699, at the request of the French
    authorities, to serve as a guide to D’Iberville in his search for the
    Mississippi. Margry says that the writer bore no relationship to the
    discoverer.</p>

  <p>La Salle’s memorial of 1684, proposing an expedition to the Gulf of
    Mexico, printed in Margry, vol. <abbr title="3">iii</abbr>., pp. 17–30, and in French’s
    “Historical Collections,” part i., pp. 37–44, also in the second series
    of French’s publication, and in Falconer’s “Mississippi,” briefly
    indicates his discoveries up to that time.</p>

  <p>The French documents, collected by Brodhead in the archives of the
    Departments of Marine and of War, and printed in the ninth volume of
    the “Documents relative to the Colonial History of New York,” Albany,
    1855, include official correspondence which reports the movements of
    the explorers from time to time.</p>

  <p>Shea promises an edition of a journal by Peñalossa, which will show the
    mercenary motives which inspired La Salle. Margry prints some documents
    concerning Peñalossa’s propositions to lead a party of buccaneers from
    St. Domingo to unite with La Salle in an attack on the Spanish mines in
    New Mexico.</p>

  <h3>LA SALLE’S VOYAGE TO THE GULF OF MEXICO AND ATTEMPT TO DISCOVER THE
    MISSISSIPPI—1684–87</h3>

  <p>In 1683 La Salle returned to France and presented, in two memorials to
    the king, propositions for an expedition to colonize the Mississippi,
    and take possession of the Spanish mines in New Mexico. The first
    memorial, which gives a brief account of his previous achievements,
    is in Margry’s Collection, vol. <abbr title="3">iii</abbr>., pp. 17–30. A translation is in
    French’s “Historical Collections,” part i., pp. 37–44; also in the
    second series,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span> pp. 1–15, of the same publication, and in Falconer’s
    “Mississippi.” The second, which defines his schemes at greater length,
    is printed in Margry, vol. <abbr title="2">ii</abbr>., pp. 359–369; in English, in French’s
    “Historical Collections,” part i., pp. 25–34. The accessory official
    documents relating to various features and stages of the expedition
    are included in the second and third volumes of Margry’s Collection.
    We have two narratives by members of this expedition, which relate its
    history from the time of departure from France down to and after the
    death of La Salle. The first to appear in print was Douay’s, which
    was published by Le Clercq in his “Premier Établissement de la Foy,”
    Paris, 1691. Shea printed a translation of it in the “Discovery and
    Exploration of the Mississippi,” New York, 1853.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> A comparison of
    Douay’s journal with Joutel’s narrative is made by Shea in his edition
    of Le Clercq, published at New York in 1881.</p>

  <p>Joutel, who seems to have been next in command to La Salle, kept a
    journal, which is published for the first time in its integrity in
    Margry’s Collection, vol. <abbr title="3">iii</abbr>., pp. 89–534. An abridged and modified
    version of this narrative was published at Paris in 1713, under the
    title, “Journal historique due dernier Voyage que feu M. de La Salle,
    fit dans le Golfe du Mexique.” Joutel complained that changes were
    made by the editor in retouching the work for publication. The text
    published by Margry is much fuller than the printed edition. An English
    translation of the Paris production, under the title, “Journal of the
    Last Voyage performed by M. de La Salle,” etc., was published at London
    in 1714, and in 1719 another edition was brought out as “Joutel’s
    Journal of his Voyage to Mexico and Canada.” An edition in Spanish was
    published at New York in 1831, with the title, <span lang="es">“Dario histórico del
    último Viaje que M. de la Salle hijo para descubrir el desembocadero
    y curso del Mississipi.”</span> Charlevoix says that Joutel was the most
    reliable of La Salle’s followers, and Parkman thinks that he “gives the
    impression of sense, intelligence, and candor throughout,” while Douay,
    in the latter’s opinion, did not always write honestly. Jean Cavelier,
    an older brother of La Salle’s, who, after the latter’s assassination,
    escaped to Canada in company with Joutel and Douay, is said to have
    drawn up a report of the expedition for M. de Seignelay, the Minister
    of Marine.</p>

  <p>Parkman possesses a manuscript which he says is a portion of the first
    draft of this report. Dr. Shea edited Parkman’s document under the
    title, <span lang="fr">“Relation du voyage entrepris par feu M. Robert Cavelier, sieur
    de La Salle, pour découvrir dans le golfe du Mexique, l’embouchure du
    fleuve de Missisipy. Par son frère, M. Cavelier”</span> A Manate [N. Y.] 1858,
    54 pp. 16mo, and printed a translation in his collection of “Early
    Voyages up and down the Mississippi,” Albany, 1861.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

  <p>Margry gives in his Collection, vol. <abbr title="2">ii</abbr>., pp. 501–509, a portion of
    a journal kept by Cavelier. Both these narratives from Cavalier’s
    pen are very imperfect, the former failing for the latter part of
    the expedition, and the journal stops before the landing in Texas.
    La Salle’s assassination, which took place in 1687, was witnessed by
    Douay, who gives an account in his journal. Joutel relates the event
    from the testimony of eye-witnesses, and Tonty states what he learned
    from the survivors of La Salle’s party. See also <span lang="fr">“Relation de la mort
    du Sr. de La Salle, suivant le rapport d’un nommé Couture à qui M.
    Cavelier l’apprit en passant aux Akansas,”</span> in Margry, vol. <abbr title="3">iii</abbr>., pp.
    601–606.</p>

  <p>A letter written by La Salle, March 4, 1685, erroneously dated at the
    mouth of the Mississippi, is in Margry, vol. <abbr title="2">ii</abbr>., pp. 559–563, and a
    translation is appended to Shea’s “Early Voyages.” The “Procès verbal
    fait par La Salle avant de conduire son frère au Mississipi, 18. avril
    1686,” in Margry, vol. <abbr title="3">iii</abbr>., pp. 535–549. relates La Salle’s operations
    in Texas, including his first two journeys from the Texas colony to
    find the Mississippi by land.</p>

  <p>The Spaniards, in 1689, visited the site of La Salle’s colony, and made
    prisoners of the survivors whom they found among the Indians. Two of
    these captives escaped to France, and their testimony in regard to the
    fate of the colony is given in Margry, vol. <abbr title="3">iii</abbr>., pp. 610–621.</p>

  <p>Parkman cites the official journal of this Spanish expedition, which is
    inedited. It is entitled <span lang="es">“Derrotero de la jornada que hizo el General
    Alonzo de Leon para el descubrimiento de la Bahia del Espíritù Santo,
    y problacion de Franceses.”</span> Buckingham Smith’s <span lang="es">“Colleccion de varios
    documentos para la historia de la Florida,”</span> pp. 25–28, contains a
    narrative by a member of the Spanish company, entitled <span lang="es">“Carta en que
    se da noticia de un viaje hecho á la Bahia de Espíritù Santo, y de
    la poblacion que tenian ah los Franceses,”</span> which is also inserted in
    French’s “Historical Collections,” second series, pp. 293–295. Barcia,
    in his <span lang="es">“Ensayo chronológico para la historia general de la Florida,”</span>
    Madrid, 1723, gives an account, from an unknown source, which is
    translated in Shea’s “Discovery of the Mississippi.”</p>

  <p>This closes the list of principal contemporary narratives of the first
    explorations by the French of western territory. Margry’s Collection
    contains many documents of minor interest, but important, which have
    not been noted. A journal by Minet, the engineer who returned to France
    with Beaujeu in 1686, in Margry, vol. II, pp. 589–601, and Tonty’s
    <span lang="fr">“Lettres sur ce qu’il a appris de La Salle, le voyage qu’il a fait pour
    l’aller chercher,”</span> 1686–1689, in Margry, vol. <abbr title="3">iii</abbr>., pp. 551–564, must,
    however, be mentioned.</p>

  <h3>SECONDARY AUTHORITIES.</h3>

  <p>Charlevoix’s “Histoire et Description générale de la Nouvelle France,”
    Paris, 1744, is the first historical work of value to treat of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span> the
    early explorations. Charlevoix was familiar with the country traversed
    by Marquette and La Salle, having, in 1721, followed the latter’s route
    to the Mississippi. Shea published at New York, in 1866–67, an English
    translation of this work, and in the notes which he added, embodied the
    results of his extensive studies upon the early history of America,
    showing the latest knowledge possessed of the first travellers.</p>

  <p>In 1844 Sparks issued his “Life of La Salle,” for the materials of
    which he depended upon the printed narratives of Hennepin, Joutel,
    Tonty, and the recitals in Le Clercq’s <span lang="fr">“Premier Établissement,”</span> etc.,
    being unable to obtain any of the MSS. which are now accessible.
    Sparks’ “Life of Marquette” appeared in 1845, and soon after
    Falconer’s work “On the Discovery of the Mississippi,” which contained
    translations of important MSS., was published at London.</p>

  <p>In 1853, Shea’s valuable “Discovery and Exploration of the Mississippi”
    was brought out at New York.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The contents of this work have been
    perhaps sufficiently indicated in the notices of contemporary journals,
    which are reproduced in it. In 1860 Thomassy published <span lang="fr">“Géologie
    pratique de la Louisiane,”</span> in which he presented some important
    inedited documents. This writer contemplated writing a history of
    La Salle’s exploits from the MSS. in the French archives, and, as
    a preliminary, issued in separate form the documents which he had
    collected, under the title, “De La Salle et ses relations inédites,”
    Paris, 1860. In 1869 Parkman published the first edition of his
    “Discovery of the Great West,” forming the third volume of the series
    of historical narratives upon “France and England in North America.”
    In the latest edition, published in 1879, the title was changed to “La
    Salle and the Discovery of the Great West.” In the writing of the later
    edition the author had the use of additional documentary material,
    since printed by Margry, which caused a revision of some portion of
    the work. Gravier’s <span lang="fr">“Découvertes [etc.] de La Salle,”</span> Paris, 1870, and
    the supplementary monograph published by him in 1871, add little that
    is not in Parkman’s work. The later publication corrects some errors
    and deficiencies in the first. Dr. Shea’s contributions to the history
    of the first explorations of the West, beside his “Discovery of the
    Mississippi,” New York, 1853, consist mainly of notes to the many
    important original narratives which he has edited, notably those of
    Hennepin, Le Clercq, and Charlevoix.</p>

  <p>The following works contain among the first travellers, accounts of the
    country traversed by Marquette, Hennepin, and La Salle:</p>

  <p>La Hontan, who travelled in 1689 and subsequent years, wrote “Nouveaux
    Voyages,” Paris, 1703. This work passed through several editions.
    Although adventures related by La Hontan are in many <span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>cases imaginary,
    yet, says Parkman, he “had seen much, and portions of his story have a
    substantial value.” J. Gravier, in 1700, went from the Illinois country
    to D’Iberville’s colony in Louisiana. See <span lang="fr">“Relation de Voyage en 1700
    depuis le Ilinois jusqu’à l’embouchure du Mississipi,”</span> New York, 1859
    (<i>Shea’s Cramoisy Press</i>). The <span lang="fr">“Relation de la Mississipi en 1700,
    par MM. de Montigny, De St. Cosme et Thaumur de la Source,” </span>New York,
    1861 (<i>Shea’s Cramoisy Press</i>), narrates the experiences of a
    party of the missionaries under the guidance of Tonty. An extract from
    Gravier is given in French’s Historical Collections, second series,
    pp. 79–93. St. Cosme’s and Gravier’s narratives are also included in
    Shea’s collection of “Early Voyages up and down the Mississippi,”
    Albany, 1861, where also may be found Le Seuer’s journal of a voyage
    from Louisiana to the Sioux country in 1699–1700. An extract from Le
    Seuer is given in La Harpe’s <span lang="fr">“Journal Historique,”</span> Paris, 1831, and
    in French’s Historical Collections, pt. 3. A journal by Pénicaut,
    who accompanied Le Seuer, is included in his “Annals of Louisiana,
    from 1698 to 1722,” in French’s Historical Collections, new series,
    pp. 33–162, New York, 1869. The memoirs of D’Iberville’s expedition
    to the Mississippi, in 1699–1700, contain descriptions of the lower
    Mississippi and throw light upon La Salle’s movements in that region.
    The principal documents concerning D’Iberville’s enterprises are
    printed in the fourth volume of Margry. A brief report by D’Iberville
    of his voyage on the Mississippi in 1699, is printed in French’s
    Historical Collection, second series, pp. 19–31. An anonymous narrative
    entitled, “Historical Journal; or, Narrative of the Expedition under
    D’Iberville, to explore the Colbert (Mississippi) River, 1698–99,” is
    published in French’s Historical Collection, second series, pp. 29–119.
    Both of these papers are included in Margry’s collection, volume
    iv. Sauvole was a member of D’Iberville’s company; see his “Journal
    Historique” in French’s Historical Collections, pt. 3, pp. 223–240.</p>

  <p>Father Marest’s letter on his mission at the Illinois, dated 1712,
    published in the <span lang="fr">“Lettres édifiantes,”</span> vol. <abbr title="2">ii</abbr>., and reprinted in Kip’s
    “Early Jesuit Missions,” pp. 191–227, New York, 1846, describes the
    scenes of his labors.</p>

  <p>In 1721, Charlevoix, the historian, made a journey from Canada across
    the lakes to the Illinois, and thence down the Mississippi to the Gulf
    of Mexico. He was requested by the King of France, to write an account
    of his travels. The descriptions of the country published in vol. <abbr title="3">iii</abbr>.
    of his <span lang="fr">“Histoire et Description générale de la Nouvelle France,”</span> Paris,
    1744, afford perhaps the best views of the primitive West which we have.</p>

  <p>The English editions of his travels are entitled “Journal of a Voyage
    to North America,” London, 1761, and “Letters to the Duchess of
    Lesdiguières,” London, 1763. See also French’s Historical Collection,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
    pt. 3, pp. 119–196, where his journal is reprinted from the English
    editions.</p>

  <p>On reaching the subject of <i>Maps</i>, we find that Harrisse’s Notes
    sur-la Nouvelle France contains a section upon the <span lang="fr">“Cartographie de la
    Nouvelle France, depuis la découverte jusqu’en 1700,”</span> which affords an
    extensive list of published and inedited maps.</p>

  <p>Parkman gives a descriptive account of “Early unpublished maps of the
    Mississippi and the great lakes,” in the appendix to his “Discovery
    of the Great West.” Thomassy’s <span lang="fr">“Géol. pr. de la Louisiane,”</span> has an
    appendix upon the “Cartographie de la ancienne Louisiane, 1544–1858.”
    Baldwin’s “Early maps of Ohio and the West,” Cleveland, 1875, and
    Peet’s article, “The discovery of the Ohio, Early maps,” in Amer.
    Antiquarian, vol. <span class="allsmcap">I.</span>, pp. 21–35, Cleveland, 1878, are useful
    studies of some early maps in the possession of Western historical
    societies. Hurlbut’s “Chicago Antiquities,” Chicago, 1881, contains a
    chapter upon the first maps representing that place.</p>

  <p>The following printed works contain some of the more important edited
    maps, bearing date in the original previous to 1700: Champlain’s
    “Voyages,” Paris, 1632, is accompanied by a map upon which Lake
    Superior is shown, and a <span lang="fr">“grande rivière qui vient du midy”</span> is
    represented as flowing into the lake from the south. This map, which is
    reproduced in the later editions of Champlain, is of little value in a
    geographical sense for the western country. A map of <span lang="fr">“Nouvelle France,”</span>
    showing the great lakes, is in Sanson d’Abbeville’s <span lang="fr">“L’Amérique en
    plusieurs cartes,”</span> Paris, 1656. Du Creux’s “Historia Canadensis.”
    Parisiis, 1664, contains a map dated 1660, which shows the outlines
    of the great lakes. Bressani’s <span lang="fr">“Relation abrégée de quelques missions
    dans la Nouvelle France,”</span> Montreal, 1852, contains a reproduction.
    Dollier and Gallinée’s map of 1670, showing their course in travelling
    to Ste. Marie, is reproduced in Faillon’s Historic de la col. fr., vol.
    <abbr title="3">iii</abbr>., p. 305 (see Parkman’s La Salle, p. 449, for description); Claude
    Dablon’s “Relation de la Nouvelle France, 1670–1671,” Paris, 1672,
    contains a map made about 1670 (see Parkman, p. 450); a reproduction
    is published in Foster and Whitney’s “Report on the Geology of Lake
    Superior,” Washington, 1850; Marquette’s map of 1674 accompanies the
    various editions of his narrative. The map in Thevenot’s “Recueil”
    is by Liebaux, and not by Marquette. Gravier’s Étude sur une carte
    inconnue” contains a fac-simile of a map by Joliet, probably in
    1674. This map is the first published map showing the great lakes in
    connection with the Mississippi.</p>

  <p>Shea’s edition of Dablon’s <span lang="fr">“Relation de la Nouvelle France, 1673
    à 1679,”</span> New York, 1860, has a reproduction of a map made by the
    Jesuits in 1673, showing the missions upon Lake Michigan. Hennepin’s
    <span lang="fr">“Description de la Louisiane,”</span> Paris, 1683, contains a map made
    upon data by Hennepin. The later editions of this work are also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
    accompanied by a map. Parkman gives a reproduction of the portion
    of Franqulin’s famous map, which shows La Salle’s colony on the
    Illinois, and that portion showing the lower part of the Mississippi
    is reproduced in Thomassy’s <span lang="fr">“Géologie de la Louisiane.”</span> A map made
    by Minet, the engineer of La Salle’s last expedition, which gives
    two separate views of the mouth of the Mississippi, is given in a
    reduced size in Gravier’s “La Salle,” and in Thomassy’s <span lang="fr">“Géologie
    de la Louisiane.”</span> Le Clercq’s <span lang="fr">“Premier établissement de la foy,”</span>
    Paris, 1691; Hennepin’s <span lang="fr">“Nouvelle découverte,”</span> and <span lang="fr">“Nouveau Voyage;”</span>
    La Hontan’s <span lang="fr">“Nouveaux Voyages dans l’Amérique,”</span> La Haye, 1703;
    Coxe’s “Description of Carolana,” London, 1742, and Charlevoix’s
    <span lang="fr">“Histoire de la Nouvelle France,”</span> Paris, 1744, are accompanied by
    maps made nearly contemporaneously with the publication of the works
    in question. A facsimile De Lisle’s map of 1700, which indicates the
    course of the early explorers, is in Gravier’s “La Salle” and in
    French’s Collections, pt. 2. A map by Joutel, dated 1713, accompanies
    the printed editions of his journal. Margry’s <span lang="fr">“Découvertes et
    établissements des Français,”</span> when completed, will include a volume
    devoted to maps now inedited. The third volume of this collection
    contains an outline sketch, representing La Salle’s discoveries. A
    modern map, representing countries traversed by Marquette, Hennepin,
    and La Salle, is given in Parkman’s “La Salle.”</p>

  <p>We next give a list of publications which treat of the explorations of
    the Mississippi valley, arranged in chronological order. Works which
    have been cited under different headings of this article are, in most
    cases, not included in this enumeration.</p>

  <p>La Hontan, <span lang="fr">“Nouveaux voyages dans l’Amérique Septentrionale,”</span> Paris,

      Marquette, and the fur-trader Joliet, in 1673, had reached the
      Mississippi, down which they sailed as far as the mouth of the
      Arkansas. At that point, thinking that they had sufficiently
      established the fact that the waters of the Mississippi discharged, not
      into the Gulf of California, but into the Gulf of Mexico (although they
      were then really only within seven hundred miles of its mouth) they

      Frontenac’s plans for the enlargement of the French power in Canada;
      especially in the matter of holding a council with the Iroquois, at
      Onondaga, where a treaty of peace was secured from that powerful and

      <a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> Capt. Tonti (or Tonty, as he signed his name in its
      Gallicized form) was an Italian (the son of the financier who
      instituted that form of life-insurance known as the Tontine), an
      ex-officer in the Sicilian wars, where, by the explosion of a grenade,
      he lost one of his hands. This loss was supplied, in some measure, by
      an artificial hand of iron, or some other metal, over which he always
      wore a glove, and the weight of which was, in one or two instances
      at least, felt by the savages who tried to intimidate him. Tonti’s
      name will survive in history as that of La Salle’s most faithful and
      courageous friend and lieutenant, and one who, by reason of his noble
      qualities is entitled to our admiration and respect. See also Parkman’s

      man, to whose memoirs we are indebted for much information concerning
      La Salle’s and other early explorations; though the value of his
      writings is much impaired by his tendency to tell large stories, and to
      claim for himself the credit which belonged to others; a tendency which
      seemed to increase more and more with each successive edition of his
      book.

      of approaching Spring greatly increased the difficulty of the way,
      interrupted as it was everywhere by marshes and rivers, to say nothing
      of the length of the journey, which is about 500 leagues in a direct
      line, and the danger of meeting Indians of four or five different
      nations through whose country we were to pass, as well as an Iroquois
      army which we knew was coming that way; though we must suffer all
      the time from hunger, sleep on the open ground, and often without
      food; watch by night and march by day, loaded with baggage such as
      blankets, clothing, kettle, hatchet, gun, powder, lead, and skins to
      make moccasins; sometimes pushing through thickets, sometimes climbing
      rocks covered with ice and snow, sometimes wading whole days through
      marshes where the water was waist-deep, or even more, at a season when
      the snow was not entirely melted—though I knew of this, it did not
      prevent me from resolving to go on foot to Fort Frontenac, to learn
      for myself what had become of my vessel, and bring back the things we
      needed.”—Parkman’s <cite>La Salle</cite> (Champlain edit.), i, 189–90.

      its size. The Indian name, however, compounded of <em>Missi</em>, whole,
      and <em>sipi</em>, river, more nearly describes its <em>collective</em>
      character, as the great irrigating system of this vast region,
      receiving many tributaries, both great and small.

      <p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> For, it must be remembered, the fact of the existence
        of this great river was known to the European world long before La
        Salle’s time. Its three mouths are shown in the edition of Ptolomy,
        printed at Venice in 1513—wherein the delta of the Mississippi is
        traced with more accuracy than in the maps of the next century. Dr. J.
        G. Shea, in the Introduction (pp. x-lxxv) to the volume of this series
        (<cite>The Discovery and Exploration of the Mississippi Valley, 1903</cite>)
        has very carefully and clearly epitomized the results of the earliest
        explorations down to those of La Salle, viz., that of Garay (1578); of
        De Vaca (——); of Friar Mark (1539); and of De Soto (1539); of Muscoso
        (1539–43); of De Luna (1557); of other missionary efforts (1580); and
        of others of less account, which all kept alive the knowledge of the
        great river of the North American continent called by the Spanish
        <i>_Río del Espíritu Santo</i>.</p>

      <p>Then early in the seventeenth century, came the French explorers;
        Champlain and the Jesuits (1608); Nicolet (1639); Jogues (1641);
        Allouez (1669); Dablon (1670); Marquette (1673), and Joliet—all
        of whom, by observation or report, confirmed the existence of the
        Mississippi.</p>

      <p>All of these were influenced in their labors by greed, by the spirit of
        commercialism and adventure, or by a sublime faith and religious zeal.
        It was reserved for La Salle to enter this region with the <i>distinct
        idea of colonization</i>, and of making it a source of revenue and a
        glory to the land which he represented.</p>

      <p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_125" href="#FNanchor_125" class="label">[125]</a> The concealment of the fact of La Salle’s death, which
        was maintained by this party of survivors, until, and for some time
        after, their return to France, gave rise to an heroic manifestation of
        courage and friendship, by the Chevalier Tonti, who had been left in
        charge of Fort Louis on the Illinois.</p>

      <p>Although they had been, on their journey northward, to Canada, the
        guests of that officer at Fort St. Louis, from September, 1687, till
        the end of February, 1688, they had made no disclosure of that fact.
        And, it was not until some months later, that Tonti heard of it, from
        the lips of one of his own men, Couture by name, who had been left at
        the Arkansas, and who had been told of it by the Abbe Cavelier himself.
        Meanwhile Tonti had received from and paid over to his reverend guest
        an order from La Salle for over 2,500 livres in beaver and supplies, on
        which money the party had made their further journey homeward.</p>

      <p>Learning now, for the first time, with what grief and indignation we
        may well imagine, of the death of his beloved friend and chief; and
        also that the Arkansas Indians were anxious to join with the French
        in an invasion of Mexico—which information was also followed by an
        official notification from the Governor of Canada, that war had again
        been declared against Spain, Tonti decided to rescue, if possible, the
        remaining members of La Salle’s party on the Gulf coast; and, by making
        them the nucleus of a small army, to cross the Rio Grande, and thus win
        a new province for France.</p>

      <p>Leaving the fort early in December, in a canoe, with five Frenchmen,
        an Indian warrior and two other Indians, he reached the home of the
        Caddoes in Red River, by the last of March, 1688, and was preparing
        to push on to a village eighty miles distant in search of Hiens and
        his companions, when he was left almost helpless by the refusal of
        all his men, except one Frenchman and the Indian warrior, to longer
        pursue the tiresome journey they had thus far made. But, with the two
        faithful ones, he pushed on, losing nearly all their ammunition in
        crossing a river, and finding, upon reaching the village where he had
        expected to find them, that they had been killed. As his ammunition
        was lost, and the Indians refused to furnish him guides, he could
        only return to the Arkansas country which he only reached by the end
        of July, after traversing a flooded country, in a ceaseless rain,
        sometimes by wading, sometimes by rafts, breaking their way with
        hatchets through the inundated cane brakes, and finally having to kill
        and eat their dogs. Even Tonti, the hero of many such emergencies of
        travel, confessed, “I never in my life suffered so much.” Then followed
        an attack of fever, after the abatement of which he arrived at his
        fort, in September, 1689. This heroic attempt marks, more distinctly
        than any other, the character of Tonti, who, in the language of the
        missionary, St. Cosmo, who traveled under his escort in 1699, was
        “beloved by all voyageurs—the man who best knows the country—he is
        loved and feared everywhere.” Tonti was a robust man in appearance,
        and had (as has been already said) but one hand, but he truly had a
        great soul within him—Courageous, generous and loyal. Though holding
        a captain’s commission, he had, as late as 1690, never received any
        pay; but in that year the proprietorship of the Fort St. Louis of the
        Illinois was granted to him jointly with La Forest, La Salle’s then
        lieutenant—and there they carried on a fur trade; and in 1699, they
        were granted further privileges of trade, by a royal proclamation.
        In 1702, a royal order assigned La Forest to Canada, and Tonti to
        residence on the Mississippi. Tonti, in that year, joined D’Iberville
        in Lower Louisiana, and was by him sent to secure the alliance of the
        Chickasaws. His after career or the time of his death are unknown.</p>

      <p>Never were mutiny, conspiracy and assassination more signally and
        justly followed by retribution than in the fate of these miscreants who
        had murdered La Salle—as graphically portrayed by Parkman (<cite>La Salle
        &amp; the Discovery of the Great West</cite>, ii, pp. 212–216. <i>Champlain
        edition.</i>) Exiled, by their own deeds, from Canada; in fear of their
        Spanish neighbors, whose dominion they had invaded, they were finally
        overwhelmed by an Indian attack, many of them butchered and the fort
        laid waste. Compulsory domestication among their savage captors was the
        fate of the rest; and when, in 1689 the Spanish general Alonzo de Leon
        visited the ruined fort of St. Louis in Texas, they were handed over to
        him, and expiated their sins in the naval service or prisons of Spain.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
